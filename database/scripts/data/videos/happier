# Happier

## Official Music Video

00:09 Lately, I've been, I've been thinkin'

00:12 I want you to be happier

00:15 I want you to be happier

00:18 When the morning comes,

00:20 and we see what we've become,

00:22 In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind

00:24 Not the fire that we've begun

00:27 Every argument,

00:29 every word we can't take back

00:31 'Cause with all that has happened

00:33 I think that we both know the way that the story ends

00:38 Then only for a minute

00:41 I want to change my mind

00:43 'Cause

00:44 this just don't feel right to me

00:47 I wanna raise your spirits

00:51 I want to see you smile

00:53 but

00:53 Know that means I'll have to leave

01:03 Know that means I'll have to leave

01:07 Lately, I've been, I've been thinkin'

01:10 I want you to be happier,

01:12 I want you to be happier...

01:15 When the evening falls,

01:17 and I'm left there with my thoughts

01:19 And the image of you being with someone else

01:22 well, it's eating me up inside 

01:25 But we ran our course,

01:27 we pretended we're okay

01:29 Now, if we jump together

01:31 at least we can swing far away

01:32 from the wreck we've made

01:35 Then only for a minute

01:39 I want to change my mind

01:41 'Cause

01:41 this just don't feel right to me

01:45 I wanna raise your spirits

01:48 I want to see you smile,

01:50 but

01:51 know that means I'll have to leave...

02:01 Know that means I'll

02:02 have

02:02 to

02:03 leave

02:04 Lately, I've been, I've been thinkin'

02:08 I want you to be happier,

02:10 I want you to be happier...

02:13 So I'll go

02:16 I'll go

02:18 I will go, go, go

02:23 So I'll go

02:25 I'll go

02:28 I will go,

02:30 go,

02:31 go...

02:33 Lately, I've been, I've been thinkin'

02:37 I want you to be happier

02:39 I want you to be happier...

02:43 Even though I might not like this

02:46 I think that you'll be happier,

02:48 I want you to be happier.

02:52 Then only for a minute (only for a minute)

02:56 I want to change my mind

02:58 'Cause

02:58 This just don't feel right to me

03:02 I wanna raise your spirits (wanna raise your spirits)

03:05 I want to see you smile,

03:07 but

03:08 now that means I'll have to leave

03:18 Know that means I'll have to leave

03:21 Lately, I've been, I've been thinkin'

03:24 I want you to be happier,

03:27 I want you to be happier

03:30 So I'll go

03:33 I'll go

03:35 I will go,

03:37 go,

03:38 go...
