00:36 days when 

00:39 we'd fight, we'd fight 'til I would give in

00:44 yeah, perfect disasters...

00:48 we were reaching, reaching for the rafters

00:55 and on most of the days we were searching for ways to get up and get out

00:58 of the town that we were raised yeah, cause we were done

01:03 I remember

01:04 we were sleeping in cars

01:05 we were searching for oz

01:07 we were burning cigars with the white plastic tips

01:09 'til we saw the sun

01:12 and we said crazy things like

01:14 I refuse to look back thinking days were better

01:18 just beacuse they're younger days

01:24 I don't know what's round the corner

01:26 way I feel right now I swear we'll never change

01:32 back when we were kids

01:37 swore we would never die

01:42 you and me were kids

01:46 swear that we'll never die

01:52 lights down

01:56 and we drive and we're driving just to get out

02:01 yeah, perfect disasters

02:05 yeah we were swinging, swining from the rafters

02:09 hey

02:11 we were dancing in cars we were looking for ours

02:14 we were naming the stars after people we knew

02:16 til we had to go

02:19 and we were saying things like

02:21 I refuse to look back thinking days were better

02:25 just because they're younger days

02:31 I don't know what's aroung the corner

02:33 way I feel right now I swear we'll never change

02:39 back when we were kids

02:44 swore we would never die

02:54 swear that we'll never die

03:00 nights when we kept dancing

03:03 changing all our plans and

03:05 making every day a holiday

03:10 feel the years start burning

03:12 city lights they're turning

03:15 something about this feels the same

03:20 back when we were kids

03:25 swore we would never die

03:30 you and me were kids

03:34 swear that we'll never die

03:40 I refuse to look back thinking days were better

03:44 just because they're younger days

03:48 (you and me were kids)
