# Bohemian Rhapsody

## Official Video Remastered

00:01 Is this the real life 
00:05 Is this just fantasy  
00:09 Caught in a landslide  
00:12 No escape from reality  
00:16 Open your eyes  
00:19 Look up to the skies and see  
00:27 I'm just a poor boy  
00:30 I need no sympathy  
00:32 Because I'm easy come, easy go  
00:36 Little high, little low  
00:40 Any way the wind blows  
00:43 Doesn't really matter to me  
00:49 To me  
00:57 Mama, just killed a man  
01:03 Put a gun against his head  
01:06 Pulled my trigger, now he's dead  
01:10 Mama, life had just begun  
01:17 But now I've gone and thrown it all away  
01:24 Mama, ooh  
01:30 Didn't mean to make you cry  
01:34 If I'm not back again this time tomorrow  
01:39 Carry on, carry on  
01:42 As if nothing really matters  
01:56 Too late, my time has come  
02:02 Sends shivers down my spine  
02:06 Body's aching all the time  
02:10 Goodbye everybody, I've got to go  
02:16 Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth  
02:23 Mama, ooh  
02:28 As the wind blows  
02:30 I don't want to die  
02:34 I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all  
03:07 I see a little silhouetto of a man  
03:10 Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango  
03:14 Thunderbolt and lightning  
03:15 Very, very frightening me  
03:17 Galileo, Galileo  
03:19 Galileo, Galileo  
03:21 Galileo Figaro  
03:22 Magnifico o o o o  
03:24 I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me  
03:28 He's just a poor boy from a poor family  
03:31 Spare him his life from this monstrosity  
03:35 Easy come, easy go, will you let me go  
03:38 Bismillah  
03:39 No, we will not let you go, let him go  
03:42 Bismillah, we will not let you go, let him go  
03:45 Bismillah, we will not let you go, let me go  
03:48 Will not let you go, let me go  
03:50 Never let you go, never, never, never, never let me go  
03:51 Oh oh oh oh  
03:53 No, no, no, no, no, no, no  
03:55 Oh, mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go  
03:59 Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me  
04:04 For me, for me  
04:16 So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye  
04:22 So you think you can love me and leave me to die  
04:27 Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby  
04:34 Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here  
04:56 Ooooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
05:13 Nothing really matters  
05:16 Anyone can see  
05:20 Nothing really matters  
05:24 Nothing really matters to me  
05:45 Any way the wind blows
