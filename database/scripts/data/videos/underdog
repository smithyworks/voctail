# Underdog

## Official Music Video

00:11 She was walking in the street Looked up and noticed 

00:14 He was nameless He was homeless 

00:17 She asked him his name and Told him what hers was 

00:20 He gave her a story About life 

00:22 With a glint in his eye And a corner of a smile 

00:25 One conversation A simple moment 

00:27 The things that change us If we notice 

00:30 When we look up sometimes 

00:33 They said I would never make it but I was built to break the mold 

00:38 The only dream that I been chasing is my own 

00:43 So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop 

00:46 Single mothers Waiting on a check to come 

00:49 Young teachers Student doctors 

00:52 Sons on the front line Knowing they don’t get to run 

00:55 This goes out to the Underdog

01:00 You’ll find that someday soon enough 

01:02 You will rise up rise up yeah 

01:15 She’s riding in a taxi back to the kitchen 

01:18 Talking to the driver ‘bout his wife and his children 

01:21 On the run from a country Where they put you in prison 

01:23 For being a woman And speaking your mind 

01:26 She looked in his eyes In the mirror and he smiled 

01:29 One conversation A single moment 

01:31 The things that change us If we notice 

01:34 When we look up Sometimes
