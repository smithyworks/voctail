# Stop and Stare

## Official Music Video

01:20 This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us 

01:26 It's time to make our move, I'm shaking off the rust 

01:31 I've got my heart set on anywhere but here 

01:36 I'm staring down myself, counting up the years 

01:42 Steady hands just take the wheel 

01:48 And every glance is killing me

01:53 Time to make one last appeal

01:58 For the life I lead

02:02 Stop and stare

02:04 I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere 

02:10 Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared 

02:15 But I've become what I can't be 

02:20 Oh

02:22 Stop and stare

02:25 You start to wonder why you're here not there 

02:30 And you'd give anything to get what's fair 

02:36 But fair ain't what you really need 

02:40 Oh, can you see what I see?

02:48 They're trying to come back, all my senses push 

02:54 Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could 

03:00 Steady feet, don't fail me now 

03:05 I'm-a run 'til you can't walk 

03:10 Something pulls my focus out

03:16 And I'm standing down

03:19 Stop and stare

03:22 I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere 

03:28 Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared 

03:33 But I've become what I can't be 

03:37 Oh

03:40 Stop and stare

03:43 You start to wonder why you're here not there 

03:48 And you'd give anything to get what's fair 

03:54 But fair ain't what you really need 

03:58 Oh, you don't need

04:22 Stop and stare

04:25 I think I'm moving but I go nowhere 

04:30 Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared 

04:35 I've become what I can't be

04:40 Oh, do you see what I see?
