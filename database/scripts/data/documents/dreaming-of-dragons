# Dreaming of dragons? Here’s where they really live

## How to see Komodo dragons in the Indonesian wilds or at a North American zoo.

DRAGONS REALLY EXIST. No, they can’t breathe fire. And you definitely won’t see them fly through the air (unless you’re viewing a SpaceX launch—the reusable spacecraft is named Crew Dragon). But at 10 feet in length and more than 300 pounds, Komodo dragons are the closest thing we’ve got to the mythical beasts that haunt our dreams (and kids’ cartoons).

The cool thing about these creatures is that even though they are massive meat-eaters, they are also extremely accessible. You can see them at zoos throughout the U.S., such as the Louisville Zoo in Kentucky, Toledo Zoo & Aquarium in Ohio, or Pittsburgh Zoo in Pennsylvania, which have recently reopened after COVID-19 shutdowns. Other zoos with Komodo dragons—currently closed due to the pandemic—include the Smithsonian’s National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C. and the Bronx Zoo.But to see them in their native habitat, you would have to travel to one of four Indonesian islands. What you cannot do is wander by yourself—because the woods are full of dragons.

This has led to the creation of a thriving tourist industry that can get you up close and personal with the gigantic, carnivorous beasts. But visitors do need to take serious precautions before entering Komodo National Park. To protect the dragons’ habitat, less than 5 percent of the park is open to tourists, and each visitor must be accompanied by a guide or ranger armed with a 6-foot-long wooden staff.

“They use that to just push the dragon off if one takes a bit too much interest in you,” says Rob Pilley, a herpetologist and wildlife filmmaker. “We have this phrase,” says Tim Jessop, an integrative ecologist at Deakin University in Australia. “We consider Komodo dragons deadly, but not dangerous.”
