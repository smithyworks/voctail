1	\N	Chechnya	Anthony Marra	\N	t	t	[{"type":"title","content":"Chechnya"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"After her sister, Natasha, died, Sonja began sleeping in the hospital. She returned home to wash her clothes a few days a month, but those days became fewer and fewer. No reason to return, no need to wash her clothes. She only wears hospital scrubs anyway. She wakes on a cot in the trauma unit. She sleeps there intentionally, in anticipation of the next critical patient. Some days, roused by the shuffle of footsteps, the cries of family members, she stands and a body takes her place on the cot and she works on resuscitation, knowing she is awake because she could dream nothing like this. “A man is waiting here to see you,” a nurse says. Sonja, still on the cot, rubs the weariness from her eyes. “About what?” The nurse hesitates. “He’s right out here.” A minute later in the hallway the man introduces himself. “My name is Akhmed.” He speaks Russian without an accent, but by now Sonja feels more comfortable conversing in Chechen. A short beard descends from Akhmed’s face. For a moment she thinks he’s a religious man, then remembers that most men have grown their beards out. Few have shaving cream, fewer have mirrors. The war has made the country’s cheeks and chins devout. He gestures to a small girl, no older than eight, standing beside him. “My wife and I cannot care for her,” Akhmed says. “You must take her.” “This isn’t an orphanage.” “There are no orphanages.” The request is not uncommon. The hospital receives humanitarian aid, has food and clean water. Most important, it tends to the injured regardless of ethnicity or military affiliation, making the hospital one of the few larger buildings left untargeted by either side in the war. Newly injured arrive each day, too many to care for. Sonja shakes her head. Too many dying; she cannot be expected to care for the living as well. “Her father was taken by the rebels on Saturday. On Sunday the army came and took her mother.” Sonja looks at the wall calendar, as if a date could make sense of the times. “Today is Monday,” she says. Akhmed glowers. Sonja often sees defiance from rebels and occasionally from soldiers, but rarely from civilians. “I can’t,” she says, but her voice falters, her justification failing. “I was a medical student before the war,” Akhmed says, switching to Chechen. “In my final year. I will work here until a home is found for the girl.” Sonja surveys the corridor: a handful of patients, no doctors. Those with money, with advanced degrees and the foresight to flee the country, have done so. “Parents decide which of their children they can afford to feed on which days. No one will take this girl,” Sonja says. “Then I will keep working.” “Does she speak?” Sonja looks to the girl. “What’s your name?” “Havaa,” Akhmed answers. Six months earlier Sonja’s sister, Natasha, was repatriated from Italy. When Sonja heard the knock and opened the door, she couldn’t believe how healthy her sister looked. She hugged her sister, joked about the padding on her hips. Whatever horrors Natasha had experienced in the West, she’d put fat around her waist. “I am home,” Natasha said, holding the hug longer than Sonja thought necessary. They ate dinner before the sun went down, potatoes boiled over the furnace. The army had cut the electric lines four years earlier. They had never been repaired. Sonja showed her sister to the spare room by candlelight, gestured to the bed. “This is the place you sleep, Natasha.” They spent the week in a state of heightened civility. No prying questions. All talk was small. What Sonja noticed, she did not comment on. A bottle of Ribavirin antiviral pills on the bathroom sink. Cigarette burns on Natasha’s shoulders. Sonja worked on surgeries, and Natasha worked on sleeping. Sonja brought food home from the hospital, and Natasha ate it. Sonja started the fire in the morning, and Natasha slept. There were mornings, and there were nights. This is life, Sonja thought. Akhmed is true to his word. Five minutes after Sonja accepts the girl, he is washed and suited in scrubs. Sonja takes him on a tour of the hospital. All but two wings are closed for lack of staff. She shows him the cardiology, internal medicine, and endocrinology wards. A layer of dust covers the floors, their footprints leaving a trail. Sonja thinks of the moon landing, how she saw the footage for the first time when she arrived in London. “Where is everything?” Akhmed asks. Beds, sheets, hypodermics, disposable gowns, surgical tape, film dressing, thermometers, IV bags, forceps—any item of practical medical use is gone. Empty cabinets, open drawers, locked rooms, closed blinds, taped-over windowpanes, the stale air remain. “The trauma and maternity wards. And we’re struggling to keep them both open.” Akhmed runs his fingers through his beard. “Trauma, that’s obvious. You have to keep trauma open. But maternity?” Sonja’s laugh rings down the empty hall. “I know. It’s funny, isn’t it? Everyone is either fucking or dying.” “No.” Akhmed shakes his head, and Sonja wonders if he’s offended by her profanity. “They are coming into the world, and they are leaving the world and it’s happening here.” Sonja nods, wonders if Akhmed is religious after all."}]
2	\N	Mrs. Bad Dream	John Morris	\N	t	f	[{"type":"title","content":"Mrs. Bad Dream"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When my brother and I got home from school one afternoon, there was a round little woman sitting at the kitchen counter in our apartment. She was reading a paperback, drinking an orange soda, guarding a purse as big as an overnight bag in her lap. She looked as if she’d wandered in, as if she thought the bus stopped there. We stood in the doorway and watched her, until finally she glanced up and announced in a high, sweet voice that she was Mrs. Bad Dream, that she’d stay until our father got home with dinner, and that she hoped he wouldn’t be late, because Mr. Bad Dream was expecting her. Then she went back to her book. My brother, who was in the seventh grade and didn’t see the point of babysitters, went off to our bedroom. I sat alone on the couch in the living room. With her perched just a few feet behind me, I didn’t feel like watching TV. And I had a policy against doing homework before dinner. That left talking to the babysitter. Babysitters always wanted to talk; maybe they were sorry for us. My brother hated the talking—and the pity—but I didn’t mind. I turned and asked her what her book was about."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"“It’s about a famous tree,” she said, not looking up. “In New Hampshire.”"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"“We had a pawpaw tree in the backyard at our old house,” I said. “My mom would make jam. I didn’t really like it, though.” She had no reply to that, so I let her read."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When our father got home—on time—Mrs. Bad Dream put her book in her purse, climbed off the stool, told him we’d been perfect angels, and went home to Mr. Bad Dream."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"She was back the next day with a different book. I asked what it was. “It’s about a boy who grew up on a farm in the old days,” she said. I told her my grandfather grew up on a farm, but she wasn’t impressed. The following day she was still reading about the farm boy, but the day after that she had another book. “It’s about a dog who works in a maternity ward,” she said when I asked. “I don’t usually care much for dogs, but this one seems pretty sensible.” I said I liked dogs okay, but my mom never let us have one, and now in the apartment we weren’t allowed to. “Mr. Bad Dream really wants a dog, but he’s allergic,” she said. I said I was allergic to wool but no one believed me."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"What was her name, really? You can look up people these days, find out everything about them, but only if you know their name. My brother says it was Mrs. Battery, but he’s thinking of another babysitter."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"She came regularly for the next few weeks, and when she had a new book I’d ask her about it. I may not be remembering some of them quite right. But I know there was one about a mountain climber who found a bear cub that its mother had abandoned. He and the cub lived together in a shelter on the side of a mountain. He taught it to plant vegetables and count to four. “They made a movie out of it,” Mrs. Bad Dream told me. I said I hadn’t seen the movie, and she said she hadn’t either. “Mr. Bad Dream and I don’t see a lot of movies these days.” Another was about a circus clown who solved crimes. He had a girlfriend who was a trapeze artist. While she was twirling around she’d watch everything going on below and give him secret signals. I said I’d get pretty dizzy on a trapeze, and she said she would be all right, but Mr. Bad Dream might throw up. She laughed."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Was it Mrs. Batting? Mrs. Bawdry? Mrs. Boundary?"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The next time she didn’t wait for me to ask. After my brother disappeared, she held up her book and said, “You’d like this one. It’s about a man in Russia who digs a tunnel under the snow for two hundred miles to get away from the Bolsheviks. He eats roots and little animals that he finds hibernating down there. Pikas.” That did sound interesting. I asked her if I could borrow it when she was done. She looked frightened. “Oh, no, I couldn’t. It belongs to Mr. Bad Dream. It’s one of his favorites.” Our father was very late that day, and she had to improvise a dinner for us, lamenting about poor Mr. Bad Dream going hungry and his blood sugar problems. And then my brother wouldn’t eat it. He was still sulking about our mother canceling her next weekend with us. It was the second time that month. The following day, a Friday, Mrs. Bad Dream was very cross, so I left her alone. But as she was leaving she handed me the book. “Mr. Bad Dream says it’s okay,” she said. “But you mustn’t lose it.”"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I read it over the weekend. It was work sometimes, but I wanted to tell her my opinion of it. On the bus on Monday, I thought out what I’d say. I liked when it was just the man in the tunnel, digging or looking for pikas or resting in the dark, wrapped up in his big coat. And there was some good suspense, like when he heard voices right above his head. But he spent too much time thinking about other things—conversations he’d had with people, places he’d lived, Russian history, and chess. There was a lot of chess. I got that he was lonely, but maybe he could have had an animal who was his friend, like a raccoon or a bear cub. And there could have been other tunnels, with other people escaping, but he never met them, never saw them, except when the tunnels happened to cross. They could work out a plan where they’d dig right up to where the Bolsheviks were and jump out of their tunnels and fight them and beat them. And he’d find the one woman he kept thinking about, the one who wrote poetry, locked up there in the Bolsheviks’ prison, and he’d rescue her. That would be a good ending."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I didn’t know if Mrs. Bad Dream would agree. Maybe she enjoyed reading about Russian history and chess. But when we got home there was another babysitter waiting for us, a younger one with long straight hair, big round glasses, and big round earrings. She said she was thrilled to meet us and she was sure we’d get along if we all followed some simple ground rules. My brother and I agreed that she was hateful. It was good to agree about something for once. She was the last babysitter we had; six months later she and my father got married."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When it was clear Mrs. Bad Dream wasn’t coming back, I asked my father where she lived, so I could return the book. He said he wasn’t sure, and I didn’t ask again. It had already been a few weeks, and I was afraid to see her, afraid that she and Mr. Bad Dream might be mad. I pictured him lying in his recliner, missing his favorite book and cursing the boy who’d stolen it. And her perched in someone else’s kitchen, trying to read, while careless children romped around her like bear cubs. I worried about it, and then after a while I forgot. I probably still have the book, in that box in the attic with a lot of other things I’ve never returned."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I saw her one more time, ten or fifteen years later. At least I think I did. A round little woman was waiting to cross a street downtown. Rounder and littler than I remembered, and old. How old had she been before? A young woman stood beside her, holding her arm, and I stepped up on her other side. She eyed me for a second, not turning her head. I nodded. Mrs. Banshee? Mrs. Benzene? She eyed me again. I smiled. What could I say to her? “I still have Mr. Bad Dream’s book?” With a quick, jerky motion, she looked me up and down. Then she hissed at me, like a cat. The light turned. The young woman glared at me and helped her off the curb. I waited for the next light. It probably wasn’t her."}]
3	\N	A Boehmian Scandal	Arthur Conan Doyle	A Bohemian Scandal is the first story about the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes and his adventures.	t	t	[{"type":"title","content":"A Bohemian Scandal"},{"type":"subtitle","content":"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men`s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high - power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion."}]

The open doors of the shops and taverns look out upon God's world disconsolately, like hungry mouths; there is not even a beggar near them. \\"So you bite, you damned brute?\\" Otchumyelov hears suddenly. \\"Lads, don't let him go! Biting is prohibited nowadays! Hold him! ah . . . ah!\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There is the sound of a dog yelping. Otchumyelov looks in the direction of the sound and sees a dog, hopping on three legs and looking about her, run out of Pitchugin's timber-yard. A man in a starched cotton shirt, with his waistcoat unbuttoned, is chasing her. He runs after her, and throwing his body forward falls down and seizes the dog by her hind legs. Once more there is a yelping and a shout of \\"Don't let go!\\" Sleepy countenances are protruded from the shops, and soon a crowd, which seems to have sprung out of the earth, is gathered round the timber-yard. \\"It looks like a row, your honour . . .\\" says the policeman."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Otchumyelov makes a half turn to the left and strides towards the crowd.

In this man Otchumyelov recognises Hryukin, the goldsmith. The culprit who has caused the sensation, a white borzoy puppy with a sharp muzzle and a yellow patch on her back, is sitting on the ground with her fore-paws outstretched in the middle of the crowd, trembling all over. There is an expression of misery and terror in her tearful eyes."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\\"What's it all about?\\" Otchumyelov inquires, pushing his way through the crowd. \\"What are you here for?

5	\N	A conversation from the third floor	Mohamed Elbisatie	\N	t	f	[{"type":"title","content":"A conversation from the third floor"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"She came to the place for the second time. The policeman stared down at her from his horse. The time was afternoon. The yellow-coloured wall was stretched right along the road. Inside the wall was a large rectangular three- storey building; its small identical windows looked more like dark apertures. The woman stood a few paces away from the horse. The policeman looked behind him at the windows, then at the woman. He placed both hands on the pommel of the saddle and closed his-eyes. After a while the horse moved. It was standing halfway down the street. Then, a moment later, it made a half-turn and once again stood itself at the top of the street. The woman came two steps forward. The horse bent one of its forelegs, then gently lowered it. “Sergeant, please, just let me say two words to him.” His eyes remained closed, his hands motionless on the pommel. Above the wall stretched a fencing of barbed wire at the end of which was a wooden tower. Inside there stood an armed soldier. The woman took another step forward. “ You see, he’s been transferred ...” The sun had passed beyond the central point in the sky. Despite this the weather was still hot. A narrow patch of shade lay at the bottom of the wall. The woman transferred the child to her shoulder. When she again looked at the policeman’s face, she noticed two thin lines of sweat on his forehead. Quietly she moved away from in front of the horse and walked beside the wall. About halfway along it she sat down on a heap of stones opposite the building. The prisoners’ washing, hung by the arms and legs, could be seen. She took the child between her hands and lifted him above her head. She noticed his arms suddenly being withdrawn inside and his hands gripping the iron bars of the window. Then his face disappeared from view. For a while she searched for him among the faces that looked down. She lowered her arms a little and heard shouts of laughter from the window. She spotted his arm once again stretching outwards, then his face appeared clearly in the middle. “Up, Aziza. Up. Face him towards the sun so I can see him.” She lowered her arms for a moment, then raised him up again, turning his face towards the sun. The child closed his eyes and burst out crying. “He’s crying.” He turned round, laughing. “The boy’s crying! The little so-and-so! Aziza, woman, keep him crying!” He cupped his hand round his mouth and shouted, “Let him cry!” Again he laughed. A few shouts went up around him. She heard their words and shouting. Then she saw his large nose poking out through the bars, “Woman! Don’t be silly, that’s enough! Cover tile boy- he’ll get sunstroke!” She hugged the child to her chest and saw the soldier withdrawing inside the tower, “Did you prune the two date palms?” She shook her head. “Why not? Why don’t you talk? I’m being transferred. Pass by Abu Ismail and tell him I send him my best wishes. He’ll do it as a favour and prune the trees, then you can bring along a few dates. Did you bring the cigarettes?” She made a sign with her hand. “Talk. What are you saying?” “You’ve got ‘em,” “Louder, woman.” “You’ve got ‘em, I sent them to you.” “When?” “Just Now.” Her face was against the sun. She shifted her head-veil slightly from her head. “They took a couple of packets. Never mind, Aziza. Never mind.” He laughed. His voice had become calm. The other faces disappeared from above him, only a single face remaining alongside his. “Did you build the wall?” “Not yet.” “Why not?\\" “When Uncle Ahmed lights the furnace, I’ll get some bricks from him.” “All right. Be careful on the tram. Look after the boy.” She remained standing. “Anything you want?” “No.” She gazed at his face, his large nose, his bare arms. She smiled. The face next to him smiled back. Suddenly be shouted. “Did you get the letter? I’m being transferred.” “Where to?” “I don’t know.” “When?” “You see, they’re pulling down the prison.” “Where will you go?” “God knows-anywhere. No one knows.” “When?” “In two or three days. Don’t come here again. I’ll let you know when I’m transferred. Has the boy gone to sleep?” “No, he’s awake.” He stared back for a while in silence. “Aziza !” Again there was silence. The face alongside his smiled, then slowly slid back inside and disappeared. Her husband remained silent, his arms around the bars. Suddenly he glanced behind him and quickly drew in his arms. He signalled to her to move away, then disappeared from the window. She stepped back, though she remained standing looking up at the window."}]
6	\N	A Vine on a House	Ambrose Bierce	This work appears in Bierce's 1913 collection of short stories, Present at a Hanging and Other Ghost Stories, but it's original publication date is 1905.	t	f	[{"type":"title","content":"A Vine on a House"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"About three miles from the little town of Norton, in Missouri, on the road leading to Maysville, stands an old house that was last occupied by a family named Harding. Since 1886 no one has lived in it, nor is anyone likely to live in it again. Time and the disfavor of persons dwelling thereabout are converting it into a rather picturesque ruin. An observer unacquainted with its history would hardly put it into the category of \\"haunted houses,\\" yet in all the region round such is its evil reputation. Its windows are without glass, its doorways without doors; there are wide breaches in the shingle roof, and for lack of paint the weatherboarding is a dun gray. But these unfailing signs of the supernatural are partly concealed and greatly softened by the abundant foliage of a large vine overrunning the entire structure. This vine--of a species which no botanist has ever been able to name--has an important part in the story of the house."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Harding family consisted of Robert Harding, his wife Matilda, Miss Julia Went, who was her sister, and two young children. Robert Harding was a silent, cold-mannered man who made no friends in the neighborhood and apparently cared to make none. He was about forty years old, frugal and industrious, and made a living from the little farm which is now overgrown with brush and brambles. He and his sister-in-law were rather tabooed by their neighbors, who seemed to think that they were seen too frequently together--not entirely their fault, for at these times they evidently did not challenge observation. The moral code of rural Missouri is stern and exacting."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Mrs. Harding was a gentle, sad-eyed woman, lacking a left foot. At some time in 1884 it became known that she had gone to visit her mother in Iowa. That was what her husband said in reply to inquiries, and his manner of saying it did not encourage further questioning. She never came back, and two years later, without selling his farm or anything that was his, or appointing an agent to look after his interests, or removing his household goods, Harding, with the rest of the family, left the country. Nobody knew whither he went; nobody at that time cared. Naturally, whatever was movable about the place soon disappeared and the deserted house became \\"haunted\\" in the manner of its kind."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"One summer evening, four or five years later, the Rev. J. Gruber, of Norton, and a Maysville attorney named Hyatt met on horseback in front of the Harding place. Having business matters to discuss, they hitched their animals and going to the house sat on the porch to talk.

In their ramifications and doublings back upon themselves they made a compact network, having in size and shape an amazing resemblance to the human figure.

7	\N	Canada unit major offer accepted by union	Unknown journalist	Article from Oct 19 1987, Toronto	t	t	[{"type":"title","content":"Canada unit major offer accepted by union"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Canadian Auto Workers' Union said it accepted an economic offer from the Canadian division of General Motors Corp &lt;GM> in contract negotiations. But union president Bob White said many local issues at the 11 plants in Ontario and Quebec still remained unresolved ahead of Thursday's deadline for a strike by 40,000 workers. \\"It minimizes the possibility of a strike,\\" White told reporters. However, \\"if we don't have local agreements settled by Thursday, there will be a strike,\\" he said. The local issues still unresolved involved health care, skilled trades and job classifications, White said. GM Canada negotiator Rick Curd said he believed a strike would be avoided. \\"Even though there are some tough issues to be resolved we're on the right schedule to meet the target,\\" Curd said. \\"I'm very pleased with the state of the negotiations,\\" he said. Union membership meetings have been scheduled for the weekend in case a tentative settlement, said White. White said the union has also received assurances that a job protection pact negotiated with GM workers in the U.S. does not threaten Canadian jobs. The economic offer for a three-year pact largely matches agreements at Ford and Chrysler in Canada, which include inflation-indexed payments for future retirees and fixed annual payments for current retirees. It also gives workers wage increases of three pct immediately and 1.5 pct in each of the second and third years."}]

Out upon her for a kitchen-maid!\\" They took away her pretty dresses, and put on her an old grey kirtle, and gave her wooden shoes to wear. \\"Just look now at the proud princess, how she is decked out!\\" cried they laughing, and then they sent her into the kitchen. There she was obliged to do heavy work from morning to night, get up early in the morning, draw water, make the fires, cook, and wash. Besides that, the sisters did their utmost to torment her, mocking her, and strewing peas and lentils among the ashes, and setting her to pick them up.

And when he reached home he gave to the step-daughters what they had wished for, and to Cinderella he gave the hazel-twig. She thanked him, and went to her mother's grave, and planted this twig there, weeping so bitterly that the tears fell upon it and watered it, and it flourished and became a fine tree.

But he had laid a plan, and had caused all the steps to be spread with pitch, so that as she rushed down them the left shoe of the maiden remained sticking in it. The prince picked it up, and saw that it was of gold, and very small and slender. The next morning he went to the father and told him that none should be his bride save the one whose foot the golden shoe should fit. Then the two sisters were very glad, because they had pretty feet. The eldest went to her room to try on the shoe, and her mother stood by. But she could not get her great toe into it, for the shoe was too small; then her mother handed her a knife, and said, \\"Cut the toe off, for when you are queen you will never have to go on foot.\\" So the girl cut her toe off, squeezed her foot into the shoe, concealed the pain, and went down to the prince. Then he took her with him on his horse as his bride, and rode off. They had to pass by the grave, and there sat the two pigeons on the hazel bush, and cried, \\"There they go, there they go! There is blood on her shoe; The shoe is too small, Not the right bride at all!\\" Then the prince looked at her shoe, and saw the blood flowing. And he turned his horse round and took the false bride home again, saying she was not the right one, and that the other sister must try on the shoe. So she went into her room to do so, and got her toes comfortably in, but her heel was too large. Then her mother handed her the knife, saying, \\"Cut a piece off your heel; when you are queen you will never have to go on foot.\\" So the girl cut a piece off her heel, and thrust her foot into the shoe, concealed the pain, and went down to the prince, who took his bride before him on his horse and rode off. When they passed by the hazel bush the two pigeons sat there and cried, \\"There they go, there they go! There is blood on her shoe; The shoe is too small, Not the right bride at all!\\" Then the prince looked at her foot, and saw how the blood was flowing from the shoe, and staining the white stocking. And he turned his horse round and brought the false bride home again. \\"This is not the right one,\\" said he, \\"have you no other daughter?\\" - \\"No,\\" said the man, \\"only my dead wife left behind her a little stunted Cinderella; it is impossible that she can be the bride.\\" But the King's son ordered her to be sent for, but the mother said, \\"Oh no! she is much too dirty, I could not let her be seen.\\" But he would have her fetched, and so Cinderella had to appear. First she washed her face and hands quite clean, and went in and curtseyed to the prince, who held out to her the golden shoe. Then she sat down on a stool, drew her foot out of the heavy wooden shoe, and slipped it into the golden one, which fitted it perfectly. And when she stood up, and the prince looked in her face, he knew again the beautiful maiden that had danced with him, and he cried, \\"This is the right bride!\\" The step-mother and the two sisters were thunderstruck, and grew pale with anger; but he put Cinderella before him on his horse and rode off. And as they passed the hazel bush, the two white pigeons cried, \\"There they go, there they go!

9	\N	Energy Petrochemical Industry	Julie Vormann	Newpaper article from April 8, 1987 in Houston	t	t	[{"type":"title","content":"Energy Petrochemical Industry"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc, the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. \\"I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,\\" said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co, adding, \\"There's no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones.\\" Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit argins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. \\"I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,\\" Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Pace's John Dosher. Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical  acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. \\"Companies like DuPont and Monsanto Co spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated,\\" Dosher said. \\"But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market.\\" Some top chemical executives share the concern. \\"The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes,\\" GAF's Heyman cautioned. \\"The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.\\" Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. \\"This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business,\\" Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth."}]

With everything changed and in new places I can say to myself, no one has been here yet, not a soul—and now, I get a chance to choose, all over again—I must be very determined after all, to make things fresh and stay on guard this time. Yes, I get a chance to choose all over again, and so why not make use of such an opportunity in a very delightful way and throw a little party, because it is perfectly clear to me now who I will invite and who will not know a thing about it—until after perhaps, there might be some people who were not invited who might come to know a thing or two about it afterwards."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And that’s just fine, that’s fine by me.

This is my house—it doesn’t have any curtains and half the time half the door is open, that’s true. The neighbour’s dog comes in, that’s true too, and so do flies and bees, and even birds sometimes—but nobody ought to get the wrong idea— nobody ought to just turn up and stick a nose in!

Well, if you must know, that is not a spontaneous point of curiosity and I don’t wonder really because in fact I already possess a good idea—a clear picture actually—of who will sit upon the ottoman.

And as a matter of fact it might be the case that this vision preceded my fantasies about being a guest here myself and artlessly contriving to sit on the ottoman beneath the mirror—I’d go further and say the vision, the premonition if you will, of who exactly will sit on the ottoman very much instigated my fantasy of doing just the identical thing. What kind of a calamity would it now be if as it turned out the person I have very much in mind does not in fact sit upon the ottoman but leans in the doorway, for example? Just leans against the door frame and prods at the door jamb, actually. Would it appear so very eccentric if I suggested to them that in fact the ottoman is a very nice place to sit? Well of course it would, it would be very eccentric, and my friend, and by the way I don’t even have this woman’s phone number, would understandably feel a little unnerved that I’d singled her out in this way—in this strangely intimate way. Of course I could devise some kind of game that included everybody and involved me appointing each person a place in the room—that could work—that would work—but it would be stupid, even if they thought it was sort of charming and zany I would know it was absolutely bogus and stupid, and how would I live with myself for the rest of the night after that exactly?

It never is a clanger, not really, but who wants to sit in the back of a cab with a bowl covered with tin foil in their lap wondering if what it contains is going to be met with melodious condescension—who needs any of that? Give people a specific request and they arrive feeling pretty slick and raring to go. Not that the requests are issued in haphazard fashion of course—I know perfectly well who to ask to supply the cheese for example, and who to contribute the bread. It’s easy to notice what people enjoy eating, and from there it’s reasonable to infer that they’ll endeavour to procure the finest examples of whatever comestible treat it is they have cultivated a particular fancy for. And, naturally, there’ll be one or two you let off, simply because, gusto notwithstanding, they’ve never demonstrated any discriminating interest in what they eat. They’ll probably rock up with hash and breadsticks, and quite possibly a dim jar of drilled out green olives, and people who stay late will horse into the breadsticks and the following day there’ll be shards of breadstick all over the floor, ground to a powder in places, where people have stood on the bigger shards while talking to people they don’t usually talk to, or even when dancing about perhaps.

He came on his bicycle and his face was incredibly flushed, which he seemed to be enjoying very much. Indeed, it is nice to be flushed, whatever way it happens. I can’t recall what he brought with him, which surprises me—I’ve a feeling it was something that needed to be kept flat because I seem to remember that the minute he came in the door he was anxious to look inside his rucksack. It was a tart, I remember now. That’s right, he took a tarte normande from his rucksack and it was perfectly intact—and there was a bottle of Austrian white wine too with a distinctive neck which I put in the fridge right away and I don’t think I opened it until much later on— the neck was distinctive you see and I remember putting my hand around it again quite late, it was really chilled, possibly too much. There was lots of wine, more than enough, and I was pleased about that, in addition my friend with tenure brought beer and a bottle of my favourite gin, which was unexpected and very kind because that particular gin is astronomically expensive. Everyone came with something thoughtful in fact and now and then I’d bring some chicken wings out of the kitchen, or one of those pizzas that have such beautifully thin bases some people presume they’re home-made, and everyone already knew each other more or less so I could do whatever I liked and didn’t have to worry about whether so-and-so was enjoying themselves because anytime I looked around there wasn’t anyone who looked left out, but then it’s so small in here it would be pretty difficult for anyone to look left out even if they felt it."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"For a long time a man sat on the ottoman, I don’t remember which man and perhaps it alternated. I just remember jeans and boots, and of course that wasn’t at all what I’d had in mind. Quite often I’m terribly disappointed by how things turn out, but that’s usually my own fault for the simple reason that I’m too quick to conclude that things have turned out as fully as it is possible for them to turn, when in fact, quite often, they are still on the turn and have some way to go until they have turned out completely. As my friend who lives nearby frequently reminds me, that part hasn’t been revealed yet. My fascination was short-lived in any case, perhaps it lasted a fortnight, less, and it was only brought about in the first place by a blouse she wore one day—the collar, to be precise. The way her head was bowed, actually, just above the collar. So that I could see the roots of her hair, which was parted and pulled back. She was flipping through a very thick fashion magazine. One hand flipped through the magazine and the other hand was up near her face—near her chin—near her collar. What must it be like, I thought, to stand there like that, flipping through a fashion magazine? That shows you how determined I was, how utterly determined, to overhaul everything, to convince myself anything at all was possible—and obviously I must have thought that it must feel really terrific, standing there like that, flipping through a fashion magazine, wearing discreet earrings and a diaphanous collar."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Well really, I get so carried away."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The following day I took my time and returned everything gradually.

11	\N	Fugue	Maryse Meijer	Maryse Meijer's debut collection of fiction, Heartbreaker. Amelia Gray said that Heartbreaker has "the feeling of a sucker punch with the attendant knowledge that you deserved it."	t	t	[{"type":"title","content":"Fugue"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The girl works nights. In the middle of nowhere. She drives an hour to get to her job, an hour back. She can stand through her entire shift in silence, the way she is standing now. Dim white light spills down over her. The dessert freezer builds up ice. She is allowed to help herself to some chips, or beef jerky, or a cold drink. She likes how quiet it is, how dark it is. It is the quiet that brought her here. The boys are driving in the young one’s black car. They know all about girls like her, girls who are alone, girls not beautiful, but not unattractive, either. In her uniform like a mechanic, blue, no nametag: hair like thick silk. No makeup. Did you know testosterone is a just, like, a drug, the tall one says. Major drug, the youngest one says. Turn the music down, the dark-haired one says. I can’t hear anything. Shut your mouth, the young one replies, and turns the music up. The storefront is humped concrete and plate glass; they can see the girl from the road, her ponytail in the window. Hey, the tall one says, slapping the young one’s arm. Get off here. What? the young one says, focused on a smear of road kill just beyond the steering wheel. Don’t we need gas? the tall one asks, and when he points they all look. Fuck yeah, the young one says, and pulls the car around. Three slow smiles stretch inside the car. They pull in alongside the gas pumps. One of the overhead lamps is broken. They get out of the car in slow motion, like gangsters in a movie; in their heads music is playing. They hitch up their pants and push into the store. The air inside is cool, stale. They run their hands over everything: rows of gummy bears in plastic bags on pegboard, canned nuts settling in drifts of salt, bags of chips sagging on the shelves. In the beverage cases the energy drinks wink neon, lined two or three deep; cold shadows yawn behind them. The tall one spins a rack of maps and a postcard spills out of a broken pocket: Wish you were here! He kicks it under the ice cream freezer. The girl watches them from behind the register, crowned by slots of cigarettes, her palms on the counter. The boys advance from different aisles; the youngest gets to her first, then the tall one. The dark-haired one, whose eyes are also dark, almost black, is last, his thumbnail raking across the face of the magazine display as he approaches. Hey, the young one says, leaning over the counter, hip cocked. Hi, the girl replies. She looks at each of them, in order, left to right. You need some gas? she asks. Maybe, the young one says. The dark-haired one slides a lotto ticket out of a stack near the girl’s fingers; digging a dime from his pocket he scratches the card, his tongue between his teeth. Beneath the silver foil he finds four clovers. Shit, he says, rearing back with pleasure. What’d I win? The girl reads the fine print. A dollar, she says. The other boys laugh. She punches a button on the register; the drawer jumps open and the tall one leans to look inside. How much you got in there? I don’t know, she says. A few hundred I guess. She talks slow, kind of quiet, but not shy; she looks them in the eyes and smiles. What if we made you give it to us? She blows on her bangs. You got a gun? Maybe. Then I guess I’d have to give it to you. The tall one slips a dollar from the tray. Nah, he says, But we won this fair enough, right? Snapping the bill in her face. She flinches, giggling. He puts the bill in the take-a-penny-leave-a-penny tray. You should get a tip jar, he says. For real, the young one says. The tall one sucks his lips. You smoke? Sure, she replies. You wanna smoke with us? It’s good shit, the dark-haired one says, his hips caressing the front of the counter. We promise. Sounds great, she says, and if the boys were listening they could hear it—the wall clock telling them it is time to keep driving. But they aren’t listening. The blood roars in their ears. I know a good place to do it, she says. You’ve done this before? the tall one asks. Sure, she says. Haven’t you? The young one puts his hand next to hers, his pinkie dancing over the side of her palm. He looks at the others like, see? Easy. Outside, moths swarm in flammable mass against the store windows. The empty parking lot glitters, a sea of spilled tar, and they cross it into the short strip of damp grass bordering the lot and the road. Dew licks their shoes; the tall boy dips his head to smoke but the young one puts his hand over the cigarette, folds it in his palm, drops it. The girl is in front, head down, ponytail swinging, as they walk beneath the concrete horizon of the overpass, where no cars move. The young one smiles and the tall one smiles too; the dark-haired one lifts his shoulders inside his track jacket, cold from the inside. Beneath the pass the girl stops. They’re standing in a stretch of soft dirt and stone hooded by the road: beyond the girl the boys can’t see anything but the dim skeleton of a chain link fence. They stand, the girl facing the boys, and the young one rubs his toe in the dirt. So is it good? she asks. Is what good? She blinks. Your trip, she says. You’re on a road trip, right? The young one chuffs. We’re just driving. Oh, she says. Cool. What’s your name? the tall one asks. The girl cocks her head, small smile buzzing around her lips. What’s yours? she replies. You want us to guess? the dark-haired one asks, but the young one snorts, shakes his head. We’re not playing games, man. She doesn’t want to say, then she doesn’t want to say. Laura, the tall one says. She looks like a Laura. The girl looks at him. What does a Laura look like? Like you. Is that good? The tall one shrugs. It’s not bad, he says. Are we just going to stand here or what, the dark-haired one says, pushing his fists in his jacket. The young one pulls a joint out of his pocket and dances it in front of the girl. She reaches for it, but he lifts it away from her hand, whistling. I thought we weren’t playing games, the girl says. Maybe we are, maybe we aren’t, the young one says. You don’t have anything better to do, do you? No, she agrees. Then relax. Open your mouth he says, and the girl parts her thin lips. He sets the end of the joint next to her tongue. The lighter’s in my back pocket, the young one says, looking down at her pale face. The girl reaches around the young one’s waist. Her eyelid flutters when her hand bumps something cool and hard. She pulls it out. Try again, the tall one says, taking the Swiss army knife from the girl and, peeling the scissors from the steel grip, starts cutting his nails. The girl’s smile deepens. She reaches into the young one’s other pocket. Here? she says. You got it, he says, then plucks the joint from her mouth. But how about a kiss first? She tilts her head up, her lips still parted.  You want to fuck? she whispers, before he can kiss her, and for a moment the boys are frozen. Hey now, the young one says, giving the girl his smooth laugh. He grinds the lighter, flipping on its weak fire: smell of burning, of a good time. The young one takes a deep breath. The girl licks her lips. The dark-haired one sees it happen first: the emergence of the girl’s real face. Her eyes seem to blacken; her mouth discards the dull smile. She is no Laura, it occurs to him; she is not an Allison or a Sarah or a Tiffany. There is no way this girl has a name like any name they know. Hey—the dark-haired one says, trying to get the attention of the others, but they are still playing with the joint and their own anticipation; the dark-haired one might as well be a tree, or a block of night sky. The young one exhales into the girl’s open mouth. That what you want? he says. Ooh, she croons, running her finger down the young one’s chest. You’re gonna do it to me, I know it. Their smiles flicker, fade. The girl turns to snatch the knife out of the tall one’s half-clipped hands. You wanna screw me with this? What the fuck, the young one breathes, dropping the joint. He takes a step back. You, she says, You can choke me. That will feel good, won’t it? If you do that? We’re not into that shit, he says, wincing, hands up. It’s okay, she continues, pulling each tool from the red case, one by one. You can do it. I like it. The tall one reaches for his knife but she whips it high above their heads, its splayed tools twinkling. Maybe you should calm down, the dark-haired one says. The girl sharpens her gaze on him. You can watch, she says. And then you can have your turn. What the fuck is wrong with you? the young one says. Nothing, she says, blinking, eyes wider and wider. What’s wrong with you? Why isn’t your cock hard? She nudges her knee against the inside of the young one’s thigh; he jerks away. This better be a joke, he says. Why? she says. You feel like laughing? Seriously, what the fuck is your deal? Don’t you like me? I thought you liked me, the girl says, pouting. She moves her head from side to side, like a leaking balloon, lips pushed out farther and farther while making the high-pitched whimper of a dog. The knife lands in the dirt; no one moves to touch it. Her shoulders start to shake and her frown melts down and she pretends to cry, boo-hoo, cartoon sobs slashing out between her teeth. Every hair on every piece of the boys’ skin stands up. Let’s just go, the tall one says, but nobody moves. You can’t go, you haven’t done it yet, the girl says. Fuck man let’s just get— The girl slaps herself, hard, so that her lip smashes against her teeth; blood darts down her chin. She staggers to the side. No, she whispers. The boys are stuck. The night is something that congeals around them, in them, between them. They don’t know how to move. She starts to undress: shoes, socks, polo, pants. The boys stare. The clothes lay like shed snakeskin at her feet. A jagged line runs from her navel down into the lip of her underwear, and from what they can see of her breasts those, too, are shiny with scars. Fuck, the young one whispers. You want to touch me? the girl asks. We don’t want to do anything, the tall one says. Oh no? Then who did this? Do you know who did this? she says, jabbing at the scar on her belly. No, the boys say. You did it, the girl hisses. Don’t you remember? We should call someone, get someone, the cops—the dark-haired one says. Who? she says, eyes narrowing. Call who? Then she laughs, a high bright sound punching the air. Oh you bad boys, she says, her teeth pink. Such bad boys. Do you need your knife back? Is that why you haven’t done it yet? She kicks the ground, making the knife jump. Done what? Killed me! the girl shrieks. You’re crazy, the young one breathes. The girl cocks her head, smiling hard. The dark-haired one puts his hands up to his head. I don’t know what’s going on, he says. I don’t know why we don’t go. Oh you can do whatever you want, she says. There are three of you and one of me. Isn’t that fair? The boys open their mouths but the words that fall out lie in the dirt and never seem to reach the girl. In time they grow silent; they grow still as trees. Do you know how many times there isn’t anyone? she says at last. No one at all? Once I counted just six cars. Six. In eight hours. And none of them stopped, even though I was screaming as loud as I could."}]
12	\N	Hansel and Gretel	Brothers Grimm	A famous fairy tale	t	t	[{"type":"title","content":"Hansel and Gretel"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Near a great forest there lived a poor woodcutter and his wife, and his two children; the boy's name was Hansel and the girl's Grethel. They had very little to bite or to sup, and once, when there was great dearth in the land, the man could not even gain the daily bread. As he lay in bed one night thinking of this, and turning and tossing, he sighed heavily, and said to his wife, \\"What will become of us? we cannot even feed our children; there is nothing left for ourselves.\\" \\"I will tell you what, husband,\\" answered the wife; \\"we will take the children early in the morning into the forest, where it is thickest; we will make them a fire, and we will give each of them a piece of bread, then we will go to our work and leave them alone; they will never find the way home again, and we shall be quit of them.\\" \\"No, wife,\\" said the man, \\"I cannot do that; I cannot find in my heart to take my children into the forest and to leave them there alone; the wild animals would soon come and devour them.\\" - \\"O you fool,\\" said she, \\"then we will all four starve; you had better get the coffins ready,\\" and she left him no peace until he consented. \\"But I really pity the poor children,\\" said the man. The two children had not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Grethel wept bitterly, and said to Hansel, \\"It is all over with us.\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\\"Do be quiet, Grethel,\\" said Hansel, \\"and do not fret; 1 will manage something.\\" And when the parents had gone to sleep he got up, put on his little coat, opened the back door, and slipped out. The moon was shining brightly, and the white flints that lay in front of the house glistened like pieces of silver. Hansel stooped and filled the little pocket of his coat as full as it would hold. Then he went back again, and said to Grethel, \\"Be easy, dear little sister, and go to sleep quietly; God will not forsake us,\\" and laid himself down again in his bed. When the day was breaking, and before the sun had risen, the wife came and awakened the two children, saying, \\"Get up, you lazy bones; we are going into the forest to cut wood.\\" Then she gave each of them a piece of bread, and said, \\"That is for dinner, and you must not eat it before then, for you will get no more.\\" Grethel carried the bread under her apron, for Hansel had his pockets full of the flints. Then they set off all together on their way to the forest. When they had gone a little way Hansel stood still and looked back towards the house, and this he did again and again, till his father said to him, \\"Hansel, what are you looking at? take care not to forget your legs.\\" \\"O father,\\" said Hansel, \\"lam looking at my little white kitten, who is sitting up on the roof to bid me good-bye.\\" - \\"You young fool,\\" said the woman, \\"that is not your kitten, but the sunshine on the chimney-pot.\\" Of course Hansel had not been looking at his kitten, but had been taking every now and then a flint from his pocket and dropping it on the road. When they reached the middle of the forest the father told the children to collect wood to make a fire to keep them, warm; and Hansel and Grethel gathered brushwood enough for a little mountain j and it was set on fire, and when the flame was burning quite high the wife said, \\"Now lie down by the fire and rest yourselves, you children, and we will go and cut wood; and when we are ready we will come and fetch you.\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"So Hansel and Grethel sat by the fire, and at noon they each ate their pieces of bread. They thought their father was in the wood all the time, as they seemed to hear the strokes of the axe: but really it was only a dry branch hanging to a withered tree that the wind moved to and fro. So when they had stayed there a long time their eyelids closed with weariness, and they fell fast asleep. When at last they woke it was night, and Grethel began to cry, and said, \\"How shall we ever get out of this wood? \\"But Hansel comforted her, saying, \\"Wait a little while longer, until the moon rises, and then we can easily find the way home.\\" And when the full moon got up Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the way where the flint stones shone like silver, and showed them the road. They walked on the whole night through, and at the break of day they came to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the wife opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Grethel she said, \\"You naughty children, why did you sleep so long in the wood? we thought you were never coming home again!\\" But the father was glad, for it had gone to his heart to leave them both in the woods alone."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Not very long after that there was again great scarcity in those parts, and the children heard their mother say at night in bed to their father, \\"Everything is finished up; we have only half a loaf, and after that the tale comes to an end. The children must be off; we will take them farther into the wood this time, so that they shall not be able to find the way back again; there is no other way to manage.\\" The man felt sad at heart, and he thought, \\"It would better to share one's last morsel with one's children.\\" But the wife would listen to nothing that he said, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B too, and when a man has given in once he has to do it a second time."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But the children were not asleep, and had heard all the talk. When the parents had gone to sleep Hansel got up to go out and get more flint stones, as he did before, but the wife had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out; but he comforted his little sister, and said, \\"Don't cry, Grethel, and go to sleep quietly, and God will help us.\\" Early the next morning the wife came and pulled the children out of bed. She gave them each a little piece of \\"bread -less than before; and on the way to the wood Hansel crumbled the bread in his pocket, and often stopped to throw a crumb on the ground. \\"Hansel, what are you stopping behind and staring for?\\" said the father."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\\"I am looking at my little pigeon sitting on the roof, to say good-bye to me,\\" answered Hansel. \\"You fool,\\" said the wife, \\"that is no pigeon, but the morning sun shining on the chimney pots.\\" Hansel went on as before, and strewed bread crumbs all along the road. The woman led the children far into the wood, where they had never been before in all their lives. And again there was a large fire made, and the mother said, \\"Sit still there, you children, and when you are tired you can go to sleep; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening, when we are ready to go home we will come and fetch you.\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"So when noon came Grethel shared her bread with Hansel, who had strewed his along the road. Then they went to sleep, and the evening passed, and no one came for the poor children. When they awoke it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister, and said, \\"Wait a little, Grethel, until the moon gets up, then we shall be able to see the way home by the crumbs of bread that I have scattered along it.\\" So when the moon rose they got up, but they could find no crumbs of bread, for the birds of the woods and of the fields had come and picked them up. Hansel thought they might find the way all the same, but they could not. They went on all that night, and the next day from the morning until the evening, but they could not find the way out of the wood, and they were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but the few berries they could pick up. And when they were so tired that they could no longer drag themselves along, they lay down under a tree and fell asleep."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It was now the third morning since they had left their father's house. They were always trying to get back to it, but instead of that they only found themselves farther in the wood, and if help had not soon come they would have been starved. About noon they saw a pretty snow-white bird sitting on a bough, and singing so sweetly that they stopped to listen. And when he had finished the bird spread his wings and flew before them, and they followed after him until they came to a little house, and the bird perched on the roof, and when they came nearer they saw that the house was built of bread, and roofed with cakes; and the window was of transparent sugar. \\"We will have some of this,\\" said Hansel, \\"and make a fine meal. I will eat a piece of the roof, Grethel, and you can have some of the window-that will taste sweet.\\" So Hansel reached up and broke off a bit of the roof, just to see how it tasted, and Grethel stood by the window and gnawed at it. Then they heard a thin voice call out from inside, \\"Nibble, nibble, like a mouse, Who is nibbling at my house?\\" And the children answered, \\"Never mind, It is the wind.\\" And they went on eating, never disturbing themselves. Hansel, who found that the roof tasted very nice, took down a great piece of it, and Grethel pulled out a large round window-pane, and sat her down and began upon it."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Then the door opened, and an aged woman came out, leaning upon a crutch. Hansel and Grethel felt very frightened, and let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said, \\"Ah, my dear children, how come you here? you must come indoors and stay with me, you will be no trouble.\\" So she took them each by the hand, and led them into her little house. And there they found a good meal laid out, of milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. After that she showed them two little white beds, and Hansel and Grethel laid themselves down on them, and thought they were in heaven."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The old woman, although her behaviour was so kind, was a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had built the little house on purpose to entice them. When they were once inside she used to kill them, cook them, and eat them, and then it was a feast day with her. The witch's eyes were red, and she could not see very far, but she had a keen scent, like the beasts, and knew very well when human creatures were near. When she knew that Hansel and Grethel were coming, she gave a spiteful laugh, and said triumphantly, \\"I have them, and they shall not escape me!\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Early in the morning, before the children were awake, she got up to look at them, and as they lay sleeping so peacefully with round rosy cheeks, she said to herself, \\"What a fine feast I shall have!\\" Then she grasped Hansel with her withered hand, and led him into a little stable, and shut him up behind a grating; and call and scream as he might, it was no good. Then she went back to Grethel and shook her, crying, \\"Get up, lazy bones; fetch water, and cook something nice for your brother; he is outside in the stable, and must be fattened up. And when he is fat enough I will eat him.\\" Grethel began to weep bitterly, but it was of no use, she had to do what the wicked witch bade her. And so the best kind of victuals was cooked for poor Hansel, while Grethel got nothing but crab-shells."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Each morning the old woman visited the little stable, and cried, \\"Hansel, stretch out your finger, that I may tell if you will soon be fat enough.\\" Hansel, however, used to hold out a little bone, and the old woman, who had weak eyes, could not see what it was, and supposing it to be Hansel's finger, wondered very much that it was not getting fatter."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When four weeks had passed and Hansel seemed to remain so thin, she lost patience and could wait no longer. \\"Now then, Grethel,\\" cried she to the little girl; \\"be quick and draw water; be Hansel fat or be he lean, tomorrow I must kill and cook him.\\" Oh what a grief for the poor little sister to have to fetch water, and how the tears flowed down over her cheeks! \\"Dear God, pray help us!\\" cried she; \\"if we had been devoured by wild beasts in the wood at least we should have died together.\\" \\"Spare me your lamentations,\\" said the old woman; \\"they are of no avail.\\" Early next morning Grethel had to get up, make the fire, and fill the kettle. \\"First we will do the baking,\\" said the old woman; \\"I nave heated the oven already, and kneaded the dough.\\" She pushed poor Grethel towards the oven, out of which the flames were already shining. \\"Creep in,\\" said the witch, \\"and see if it is properly hot, so that the bread may be baked.\\" And Grethel once in, she meant to shut the door upon her and let her be baked, and then she would have eaten her. But Grethel perceived her intention, and said, \\"I don't know how to do it: how shall I get in?\\" \\"Stupid goose,\\" said the old woman, \\"the opening is big enough, do you see? I could get in myself!\\" and she stooped down and put her head in the oven's mouth. Then Grethel gave her a push, so that she went in farther, and she shut the iron door upon her, and put up the bar. Oh how frightfully she howled! but Grethel ran away, and left the wicked witch to burn miserably."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Grethel went straight to Hansel, opened the stable-door, and cried, \\"Hansel, we are free! the old witch is dead!\\" Then out flew Hansel like a bird from its cage as soon as the door is opened. How rejoiced they both were! how they fell each on the other's neck! and danced about, and kissed each other! And as they had nothing more to fear they went over all the old witch's house, and in every corner there stood chests of pearls and precious stones. \\"This is something better than flint stones,\\" said Hansel, as he filled his pockets, and Grethel, thinking she also would like to carry something home with her, filled her apron full. i! Now, away we go,\\" said Hansel, \\"if we only can get out of the witch's wood.\\" When they had journeyed a few hours they came to a great piece of water. \\"We can never get across this,\\" said Hansel, \\"I see no stepping-stones and no bridge.\\" \\"And there is no boat either,\\" said Grethel; \\"but here comes a white duck; if I ask her she will help us over.\\" So she cried, \\"Duck, duck, here we stand, Hansel and Grethel, on the land, Stepping-stones and bridge we lack, Carry us over on your nice white back.\\" And the duck came accordingly, and Hansel got upon her and told his sister to come too. \\"No,\\" answered Grethel, \\"that would be too hard upon the duck; we can go separately, one after the other.\\" And that was how it was managed, and after that they went on happily, until they came to the wood, and the way grew more and more familiar, till at last they saw in the distance their father's house. Then they ran till they came up to it, rushed in at the door, and fell on their father's neck. The man had not had a quiet hour since he left his children in the wood; but the wife was dead. And when Grethel opened her apron the pearls and precious stones were scattered all over the room, and Hansel took one handful after another out of his pocket. Then was all care at an end, and they lived in great joy together. My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it."}]

He treats Maggie like she’s much older than she is, like she wasn’t able to do these things without him around."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"At night they eat stew, and he catches her up on news she’s missed from the outside world. She listens to him talk in circles; there’s an edge to his politics that she doesn’t remember. His hair is long, his palms are callused. Maggie doesn’t know why he was asked to leave the ranch. She knows the place, the type of people it hires and lets return year after year, the things it sweeps under rugs. Perhaps it’s better not to ask."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"He looks for work. One day he lopes to the edge of the road and catches a ride to the big town, an hour away. When Maggie cleans his room, she gathers new information about him, strange talismans. Wild mushrooms in a neat row on his dresser. A long gray hair on his pillow. A torn piece of newspaper advertising a vacant tavern by the state line. A dark form under the bed she reaches for, then changes her mind. Her son returns after midnight and is sullen for days. She could fill a well with the things she doesn’t know."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Maggie waits for a few warm days in a row and then turns the earth to plant her seedlings. The dog fox watches from the edge of the woods. With a new litter he hunts for the whole family. He’s been known to go through the neighbor’s trash, to tear up her garden. His responsibility makes him rash and desperate. But foxes parent for one fierce, sweet season and then release. By June the cubs will be off to their own territories."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When there’s nothing else to do Maggie walks for hours through the woods. She catalogs changes: the new growth, the dead trees that have fallen or are about to fall. She has always been a quick study. Once she worked in a museum. Once she lived in a big city.

Now she can’t remember what had really been so bad about them."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"After the last frost she lets the chickens out into their yard.

She pictures her son as a boy, pulling down colorful boxes in the sugary cereal aisle. She sees his small, angry body, its clammy desperation when she would hold him back from a tantrum. So much in nature, she thinks, can be boiled down to hunger. But human hunger is a bigger, more frightening thing. She remembers the other child, the new one; she counts the months in her head until there are nine."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In her sleep that night, Maggie is visited by the parties of her youth. The lights, the strangers, the buzzing. When she wakes to a dirty kitchen, she is still fondly inside of her dream. A bottle of champagne, left over from the wedding, knocks softly against her feet. Cooking wine, a can of stout lying in its own thick brown spit. It’s like the house has been sucked dry of everything. She finds her son asleep by the door. He’s so much heavier than the last time she ever carried him. Still, she drags him out onto the porch. Then she takes his bags, his sweaters, his books, and puts them in a pile by the edge of the woods. She covers his passed-out body in a loose woolen throw. Then she goes for a long walk."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The days are so long now; the light in late evening is breathtaking. Her garden does well that year. Her chickens give far more eggs than one person could eat. She leaves them in baskets on the neighbors’ porches, with notes that Maggie hopes sound friendly. One morning she bakes a cake and eats the entire thing before noon. Then she bakes another. She’s missed this side of solitude, its boundarylessness. For months she’ll look out at the blank spot under the hemlocks, and think: Once there was a boy, who now has disappeared."}]

Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to 830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly below 1985's 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down. Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987. U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover, finance director John Edwards said. A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German competitors offered an \\"umbrella\\" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6 had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would restrict the car's price. Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a 12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of its receipts for longer periods, John Egan said. In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10 pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct of net sales and training two pct. Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the other half. The firm is in early stages of considering the building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg, but Egan said this would take at least another three years On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar's shares were last quoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday's close, after reporting 1986 results which were in line with market expectations, dealers said."}]
15	\N	Jim Baker's Blue-Jay Yarn	Mark Twain	One of Mark Twain's most famous short stories, Jim Baker's Blue-jay Yarn, was adapted from a campfire story told by Jim Gillis while Twain and Gillis were prospecting for gold during the winter of 1864-65. It must have been an interesting story in those circumstances; a story about Jays futilely filling a hole, told to men who were fruitlessly digging one. Twain transforms the original into a biting satire about human behavior and persistence.	t	t	[{"type":"title","content":"Jim Baker's Blue-Jay Yarn"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Animals talk to each other, of course. There can be no question about that; but I suppose there are very few people who can understand them. I never knew but one man who could. I knew he could, however, because he told me so himself. He was a middle-aged, simple-hearted miner who had lived in a lonely corner of California, among the woods and mountains, a good many years, and had studied the ways of his only neighbors, the beasts and the birds, until he believed he could accurately translate any remark which they made. This was Jim Baker. According to Jim Baker, some animals have only a limited education, and use only very simple words, and scarcely ever a comparison or a ﬂowery ﬁgure; whereas, certain other animals have a large vocabulary, a ﬁne command of language and a ready and ﬂuent delivery; consequently these latter talk a great deal; they like it; they are conscious of their talent, and they enjoy “showing off.” Baker said, that after long and careful observation, he had come to the conclusion that the blue-jays were the best talkers he had found among birds and beasts. Said he:—"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"“There’s more to a blue-jay than any other creature. He has got more moods, and more different kinds of feelings than other creature; and mind you, whatever a blue-jay feels, he can put into language. And no mere commonplace language, either, but rattling, out-and-out book-talk—and bristling with metaphor, too—just bristling! And as for command of language—why you never see a blue-jay get stuck for a word. No man ever did. They just boil out of him! And another thing: I’ve noticed a good deal, and there’s no bird, or cow, or anything that uses as good grammar as a blue-jay. You may say a cat uses good grammar. Well, a cat does—but you let a cat get excited, once; you let a cat get to pulling fur with another cat on a shed, nights, and you’ll hear grammar that will give you the lockjaw. Ignorant people think it’s the noise which ﬁghting cats make that is so aggravating, but it ain’t so; it’s the sickening grammar they use. Now I’ve never heard a jay use bad grammar but very seldom; and when they do, they are as ashamed as a human; they shut right down and leave."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"“You may call a jay a bird. Well, so he is, in a measure—because he’s got feathers on him, and don’t belong to no church, perhaps; but otherwise he is just as much a human as you be. And I’ll tell you for why. A jay’s gifts, and instincts, and feelings, and interests, cover the whole ground. A jay hasn’t got any more principle than a Congressman. A jay will lie, a jay will steal, a jay will deceive, a jay will betray; and four times out of ﬁve, a jay will go back on his solemnest promise. The sacredness of an obligation is a thing which you can’t cram into no blue-jay’s head. Now on top of all this, there’s another thing: a jay can out-swear any gentleman in the mines. You think a cat can swear. Well, a cat can; but you give a blue-jay a subject that calls for his reserve-powers, and where is your cat? Don’t talk to me—I know too much about this thing. And there’s yet another thing: in the one little particular of scolding—just good, clean, out-and-out scolding—a blue-jay can lay over anything, human or divine. Yes, sir, a jay is everything that a man is. A jay can cry, a jay can laugh, a jay can feel shame, a jay can reason and plan and discuss, a jay likes gossip and scandal, a jay has got a sense of humor, a jay knows when he is an ass just as well as you do—maybe better. If a jay ain’t human, he better take in his sign, that’s all. Now I’m going to tell you a perfectly true fact about some blue-jays.”"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"“When I ﬁrst begun to understand jay language correctly, there was a little incident happened here. Seven years ago, the last man in this region but me, moved away. There stands his house,—been empty ever since; a log house, with a plank roof—just one big room, and no more; no ceiling—nothing between the rafters and the ﬂoor. Well, one Sunday morning I was sitting out here in front of my cabin, with my cat, taking the sun, and looking at the blue hills, and listening to the leaves rustling so lonely in the trees, and thinking of the home away yonder in the States, that I hadn’t heard from in thirteen years, when a blue jay lit on that house, with an acorn in his mouth, and says, ‘Hello, I reckon I’ve struck something.’ When he spoke, the acorn dropped out of his month and rolled down the roof, of course, but he didn’t care; his mind was all on the thing he had struck. It was a knot-hole in the roof. He cocked his head to one side, shut one eye and put the other one to the hole, like a ’possum looking down a jug; then he glanced up with his bright eyes, gave a wink or two with his wings—which signiﬁes gratiﬁcation, you understand,—and says, ‘It looks like a hole, it’s located like a hole,—blamed if I don’t believe it is a hole!’"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"details—walked round and round the hole and spied into it from every point of the compass. No use. Now he took a thinking attitude on the comb of the roof and scratched the back of his head with his right foot a minute, and ﬁnally says, ‘Well, it’s too many for me, that’s certain; must be a mighty long hole; however, I ain’t got no time to fool around here, I got to ’tend to business; I reckon it’s all right—chance it, anyway.’"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"“So he ﬂew off and fetched another acorn and dropped it in, and tried to ﬂirt his eye to the hole quick enough to see what become of it, but he was too late. He held his eye there as much as a minute; then he raised up and sighed, and says, ‘Consound it, I don’t seem to understand this thing, no way; however, I’ll tackle her again.’ He fetched another acorn, and done his level best to see what become of it, but he couldn’t. He says, ‘Well, I never struck no such a hole as this, before; I’m of the opinion it’s a totally new kind of a hole.’ Then he begun to get mad. He held in for a spell, walking up and down the comb of the roof and shaking his head and muttering to himself; but his feelings got the upper hand of him, presently, and he broke loose and cussed himself black in the face. I never see a bird take on so about a little thing. When he got through he walks to the hole and looks in again for half a minute; then he says, ‘Well, you’re a long hole, and a deep hole, and a mighty singular hole altogether—but I’ve started in to ﬁll you, and I’m d—d if I don’t ﬁll you, if it takes a hundred years!’"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"“And with that, away he went. You never see a bird work so since you was born. He laid into his work like a nigger, and the way he hove acorns into that hole for about two hours and a half was one of the most exciting and astonishing spectacles I ever struck. He never stopped to take a look any more—he just hove ’em in and went for more. Well at last he could hardly ﬂop his wings, he was so tuckered out. He comes a-drooping down, once more, sweating like an ice-pitcher, drops his acorn in and says, ‘Now I guess I’ve got the bulge on you by this time!’ So he bent down for a look. If you’ll believe me, when his head come up again he was just pale with rage. He says, ‘I’ve shoveled acorns enough in there to keep the family thirty years, and if I can see a sign of one of ’em I wish I may land in a museum with a belly full of sawdust in two minutes!’ “He just had strength enough to crawl up on to the comb and lean his back agin the chimbly, and then he collected his impressions and begun to free his mind. I see in a second that what I had mistook for profanity in the mines was only just the rudiments, as you may say."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"“Another jay was going by, and heard him doing his devotions, and stops to inquire what was up. The sufferer told him the whole circumstance, and says, ‘Now yonder’s the hole, and if you don’t believe me, go and look for yourself.’ So this fellow went and looked, and comes back and says, ‘How many did you say you put in there?’ ‘Not any less than two tons,’ says the sufferer. The other jay went and looked again. He couldn’t seem to make it out, so he raised a yell, and three more jays come. They all examined the hole, they all made the sufferer tell it over again, then they all discussed it, and got off as many leather-headed opinions about it as an average crowd of humans could have done."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"“They called in more jays; then more and more, till pretty soon this whole region ’peared to have a blue ﬂush about it. There must have been ﬁve thousand of them; and such another jawing and disputing and ripping and cussing, you never heard. Every jay in the whole lot put his eye to the hole and delivered a more chuckle-headed opinion about the mystery than the jay that went there before him. They examined the house all over, too. The door was standing half open, and at last one old jay happened to go and light on it and look in. Of course that knocked the mystery galley-west in a second. There lay the acorns, scattered all over the ﬂoor. He ﬂopped his wings and raised a whoop. ‘Come here!’ he says, ‘Come here, everybody; hang’d if this fool hasn’t been trying to fill up a house with acorns!’ They all came a-swooping down like a blue cloud, and as each fellow lit on the door and took a glance, the whole absurdity of the contract that that ﬁrst jay had tackled hit him home and he fell over backwards suffocating with laughter, and the next jay took his place and done the same."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"“Well, sir, they roosted around here on the house-top and the trees for an hour, and guffawed over that thing like human beings. It ain’t any use to tell me a blue-jay hasn’t got a sense of humor, because I know better. And memory, too. They brought jays here from all over the United States to look down that hole, every summer for three years. Other birds too. And they could all see the point, except an owl that come from Nova Scotia to visit the Yo Semite, and he took this thing in on his way back. He said he couldn’t see anything funny in it. But then he was a good deal disappointed about Yo Semite, too.”"}]

Momma would have to go tug on him till he came inside so the neighbors wouldn’t start yapping. One night she didn’t even bother waiting up, and he was left out there on the lawn. He woke up the next day to the crunch-crunching of the garbagemen. I was running to meet friends at the pool and almost tripped over his legs. “Can you believe it, Luanne? Your momma’s abandoned me.” He was weeping into a handful of dandelions. I could see the neighbors’ silhouettes watching us behind their curtains. Momma had told me not to help him, but he grabbed at my ankle, so I gave him my lunch. It was only baloney and Swiss anyway. When I got home, Dad was still sprawled out on the front lawn like he was trying to make a snow angel out of grass. The neighbors were peeping through holes in the fence. “I married a damn fool,” Momma said. “He can rot out there for all I care.” I snuck him a pack of crackers later. He was bunched up like a pile of leaves in the dark. Up close, I noticed his face was scrunched in pain. “Luanne, love eats away at you like a colony of termites,” he said. I told him he should move inside, that he was liable to melt away in this heat, but he said the woman inside was not the same woman he married and that was a terrifying thing. Dad stayed there all summer. Momma wouldn’t talk to him, just smoked cigarettes and stared at him through the window. I was sneaking out the back door to see Jimmy Jackson that summer. He had a bright yellow motorbike and took me anywhere I wanted to go. One night, Jimmy put his hands under my shirt and said we’d never be apart. I skipped right across the yard forgetting Dad was there. He was scowling as Jimmy rode away through the night. In the weak glow of the streetlamps, his face looked thin and green. Finally Momma went outside and grabbed his arm. “All right,” she said, “we have our differences, but who doesn’t? I think we can start again.” “I fear it’s too late,” he said. When Momma tugged on his arm, he screamed in pain. The grass had already grown up through his skin and his roots had taken hold. I had stopped bringing him food weeks ago. Slowly his body grew softer and greener until it split apart into the lawn. Momma cried a lot in the bathroom with the tub running. Fall crept up on us and the summer was done. Now Dad was just a thick clump in the dirt. I kneeled next to him and put my ear to the ground. “Promise me you will keep me nice and trim,” the wind whispered through the blades. I didn’t think he could hear me anymore, but I said I would. I mow lawns all around the neighborhood. I have a shiny red mower I can spin around on a dime. I charge exactly ten dollars a yard."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"One Thing After Another To skip to the ending: they all died, the mother and the father and the five babies. Before this, the mother had already eaten most of the children, but then she rolled over, wide-eyed and bloated. Later, his girlfriend had this theory that the carpet fumes were to blame, at least for the final deaths if not for the earlier cannibalism, although perhaps that too, in a roundabout way, if the fumes had eaten into the mother’s brain. A few days earlier, they had gotten a new carpet installed and it had made the whole living room smell like a chemical factory. She had picked out a bright blue carpet to represent a new day, she had said at the time, because before the deaths they had decided to move in together or, rather, he was moving in with her, which was a serious step for him, something he had never done before even though he had dated several women for long stretches of time before her. “This just happens with small mammals,” he said afterward. He placed a hand on top of her shoulder in reassurance. She was wearing a yellow dress and looking away from him. Of course, all of this was after they had been talking about having a child of their own. They were going to have it after the wedding, which would be maybe a year after they moved in together, if all went well, but they had been talking about it long before. He had wanted to take it slow because the move was already frightening to him, even though it was only a short move in a geographic sense. He wasn’t sure if he was really ready for a child, but he knew she was and she probably only had a few years to start having them if they wanted to be safe, medically speaking. Maybe we could get a pet first,” he had said back then, before kissing her below the ear, “to make sure we can love something and make it grow.” “How about a puppy,” she had said next. They had been sitting on the porch sharing a bottle of red wine and watching the fireflies. “I was thinking hamsters,” he had said, because before all of this, many years earlier when he himself was a child, he lived in the country and was lonely and his mother had given him three hamsters that he had kept in his room in a plastic maze and watched them and played with them and tried hard to love them as best he could just as now, twenty-five years later, he was trying to do the same thing with a woman who was staring out the window and asking him what they were going to do next."}]

But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday and the Sea Isle City on Friday. Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran. Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping. But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result of U.S. intervention and Iran's response. The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a U.S. \\"tit-for-tat\\" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS. He said with this appraoch America would suffer \\"the death of one thousand cuts.\\" But for the United States to grab the initiative militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its shipping must pass, Schuler said. He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off, Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq. Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate. He said the United States should also threaten to mine and blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a settlement. Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by invading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties. Each side has attacked the others' shipping."}]

He kept on putting his things into the suitcase. Son of a bitch! I’m so glad you’re leaving! She began to cry. You can’t even look me in the face, can you? Then she noticed the baby’s picture on the bed and picked it up. He looked at her and she wiped her eyes and stared at him before turning and going back to the living room. Bring that back, he said. Just get your things and get out, she said. He did not answer. He fastened the suitcase, put on his coat, looked around the bedroom before turning off the light. Then he went out to the living room. She stood in the doorway of the little kitchen, holding the baby. I want the baby, he said. Are you crazy? No, but I want the baby. I’ll get someone to come for his things. You’re not touching this baby, she said. The baby had begun to cry and she uncovered the blanket from around his head. Oh, oh, she said, looking at the baby. He moved toward her.

He reached across the stove and tightened his hands on the baby. Let go of him, he said. Get away, get away! she cried. The baby was red-faced and screaming. In the scuffle they knocked down a flowerpot that hung behind the stove. He crowded her into the wall then, trying to break her grip. He held onto the baby and pushed with all his weight. Let go of him, he said. Don’t, she said. You’re hurting the baby, she said. I’m not hurting the baby, he said. The kitchen window gave no light. In the near dark he worked on her fisted fingers with one hand and with the other hand he gripped the screaming baby up under an arm near the shoulder. She felt her fingers being forced open. She felt the baby going from her. No! she screamed just as her hands came loose. She would have it, this baby. She grabbed for the baby’s other arm. She caught the baby around the wrist and leaned back. But he would not let go. He felt the baby slipping out of his hands and he pulled back very hard. In this manner, the issue was decided."}]

One day that the wife was standing at the window, and looking into the garden, she saw a bed filled with the finest rampion; and it looked so fresh and green that she began to wish for some; and at length she longed for it greatly. This went on for days, and as she knew she could not get the rampion, she pined away, and grew pale and miserable. Then the man was uneasy, and asked, \\"What is the matter, dear wife?\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\\"Oh,\\" answered she, \\"I shall die unless I can have some of that rampion to eat that grows in the garden at the back of our house.\\" The man, who loved her very much, thought to himself, \\"Rather than lose my wife I will get some rampion, cost what it will.\\" So in the twilight he climbed over the wall into the witch's garden, plucked hastily a handful of rampion and brought it to his wife. She made a salad of it at once, and ate of it to her heart's content. But she liked it so much, and it tasted so good, that the next day she longed for it thrice as much as she had done before; if she was to have any rest the man must climb over the wall once more. So he went in the twilight again; and as he was climbing back, he saw, all at once, the witch standing before him, and was terribly frightened, as she cried, with angry eyes, \\"How dare you climb over into my garden like a thief, and steal my rampion! it shall be the worse for you!\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\\"Oh,\\" answered he, \\"be merciful rather than just, I have only done it through necessity; for my wife saw your rampion out of the window, and became possessed with so great a longing that she would have died if she could not have had some to eat.\\" Then the witch said, \\"If it is all as you say you may have as much rampion as you like, on one condition - the child that will come into the world must be given to me. It shall go well with the child, and I will care for it like a mother.\\" In his distress of mind the man promised everything; and when the time came when the child was born the witch appeared, and, giving the child the name of Rapunzel (which is the same as rampion), she took it away with her."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Rapunzel was the most beautiful child in the world.

Let down your hair.\\" Then he saw how Rapunzel let down her long tresses, and how the witch climbed up by it and went in to her, and he said to himself, \\"Since that is the ladder I will climb it, and seek my fortune.\\" And the next day, as soon as it began to grow dusk, he went to the tower and cried, \\"O Rapunzel, Rapunzel! Let down your hair.\\" And she let down her hair, and the King's son climbed up by it. Rapunzel was greatly terrified when she saw that a man had come in to her, for she had never seen one before; but the King's son began speaking so kindly to her, and told how her singing had entered into his heart, so that he could have no peace until he had seen her herself. Then Rapunzel forgot her terror, and when he asked her to take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and beautiful, she thought to herself, \\"I certainly like him much better than old mother Gothel,\\" and she put her hand into his hand."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"She said: \\"I would willingly go with thee, but I do not know how I shall get out.

So the witch knew nothing of all this until once Rapunzel said to her unwittingly, \\"Mother Gothel, how is it that you climb up here so slowly, and the King's son is with me in a moment?\\" \\"O wicked child,\\" cried the witch, \\"what is this I hear! I thought I had hidden thee from all the world, and thou hast betrayed me!\\" In her anger she seized Rapunzel by her beautiful hair, struck her several times with her left hand, and then grasping a pair of shears in her right - snip, snap - the beautiful locks lay on the ground. And she was so hard-hearted that she took Rapunzel and put her in a waste and desert place, where she lived in great woe and misery."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The same day on which she took Rapunzel away she went back to the tower in the evening and made fast the severed locks of hair to the window-hasp, and the King's son came and cried, \\"Rapunzel, Rapunzel!

Rapunzel is lost to you; you will see her no more.\\" The King's son was beside himself with grief, and in his agony he sprang from the tower: he escaped with life, but the thorns on which he fell put out his eyes.

Not only did he bid to it his relations, friends, and acquaintances, but also the wise women, that they might be kind and favourable to the child. There were thirteen of them in his kingdom, but as he had only provided twelve golden plates for them to eat from, one of them had to be left out."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"However, the feast was celebrated with all splendour; and as it drew to an end, the wise women stood forward to present to the child their wonderful gifts: one bestowed virtue, one beauty, a third riches, and so on, whatever there is in the world to wish for.

Every one was terrified at her saying, when the twelfth came forward, for she had not yet bestowed her gift, and though she could not do away with the evil prophecy, yet she could soften it, so she said: \\"The princess shall not die, but fall into a deep sleep for a hundred years.\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now the king, being desirous of saving his child even from this misfortune, gave commandment that all the spindles in his kingdom should be burnt up.

It happened one day, she being already fifteen years old, that the king and queen rode abroad, and the maiden was left behind alone in the castle. She wandered about into all the nooks and corners, and into all the chambers and parlours, as the fancy took her, till at last she came to an old tower. She climbed the narrow winding stair which led to a little door, with a rusty key sticking out of the lock; she turned the key, and the door opened, and there in the little room sat an old woman with a spindle, diligently spinning her flax. \\"Good day, mother,\\" said the princess, \\"what are you doing?\\" - \\"I am spinning,\\" answered the old woman, nodding her head. \\"What thing is that that twists round so briskly?\\" asked the maiden, and taking the spindle into her hand she began to spin; but no sooner had she touched it than the evil prophecy was fulfilled, and she pricked her finger with it.

For now the hundred years were at an end, and the day had come when Rosamond should be awakened. When the prince drew near the hedge of thorns, it was changed into a hedge of beautiful large flowers, which parted and bent aside to let him pass, and then closed behind him in a thick hedge. When he reached the castle-yard, he saw the horses and brindled hunting-dogs lying asleep, and on the roof the pigeons were sitting with their heads under their wings.

And when he saw her looking so lovely in her sleep, he could not turn away his eyes; and presently he stooped and kissed her. And she awaked, and opened her eyes, and looked very kindly on him. And she rose, and they went forth together, and the king and the queen and whole court waked up, and gazed on each other with great eyes of wonderment. And the horses in the yard got up and shook themselves, the hounds sprang up and wagged their tails, the pigeons on the roof drew their heads from under their wings, looked round, and flew into the field, the flies on the wall crept on a little farther, the kitchen fire leapt up and blazed, and cooked the meat, the joint on the spit began to roast, the cook gave the scullion such a box on the ear that he roared out, and the maid went on plucking the fowl.

It went through the library and stopped at the front door as though it had knew the house well. This would be difficult for anyone to believe, except perhaps as the subject of a poem. Our first week in the house was spent scraping, finding some of the house's secrets, like wallpaper under wallpaper. In the kitchen, a pattern of white-gold trellises supported purple grapes as big and round as ping-pong balls. When we painted the walls yellow, I thought of the bits of grape that remained underneath and imagined the vine popping though, the way some plants can tenaciously push though anything. The day of the big snow , when you had to shovel the walk and couldn't find your cap and asked me how to wind a towel so that it would stay on your head-you, in the white towel turban, like a crazy king of snow. People liked the idea of our being together, leaving the city for the country. So many people visited, and the fireplacemade all ofthem wabt to tell amazing stories; the child who happened to be standing on the right corner when the door of the ice cream truck came open and hundreds of popsicles crashed out; the man standing on the beach, sand sparkling in the sun, one bit glinting more than the rest, stooping to find a diamond ring. Did they talk about amazing things because they thought we'd turn into one of them? Now I think they probably guessed it wouldn't work. It was as hopeless as giving a child a matched cup and saucer. Remember the night out on the lawn, knee deep in snow, chins pointed at the sky as the wind whirled down all that whiteness? It seemed that the world had been turned upside down, and we were looking into an enormous feild of Queen Anne's lace. Later, headlights off, our car was the first to ride through the newly fallen snow. The world outside the car looked solarized."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"You remember it differently. You remember that the cold settled in stages, that small curve of light was shaved from the moon night after night, until you were no longer surprised the sky was black, that the chipmunk ran to hide in the dark, not simply to a door that ledto its escape.

It had rained, and as the rain fell, the cover collected more and more water until it finally spilled onto the concrete. When I left that day, I drove past what had been our house. Three or four crocuses were blooming in the front - just a few dots of white, no field of snow. I felt embarassed for them. They couldn't compete."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This is a story, told the way  you say stories should  be told: Somebody grew up, fell in love, and spent a winter with her lover in the country.

Who expects small things to survive when even the largest get lost? People forget years and remember moments. Seconds and symbols are left to sum things up: the black shroud over the pool.

She had invested him with an almost supernatural number of high attributes and excellencies and talents, and he had absorbed the oblation as a desert drinks the rain that can coax from it no promise of blossom or fruit."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"As Trysdale grimly wrenched apart the seam of his last glove, the crowning instance of his fatuous and tardily mourned egoism came vividly back to him. The scene was the night when he had asked her to come up on his pedestal with him and share his greatness. He could not, now, for the pain of it, allow his mind to dwell upon the memory of her convincing beauty that night--the careless wave of her hair, the tenderness and virginal charm of her looks and words. But they had been enough, and they had brought him to speak. During their conversation she had said:"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\\"And Captain Carruthers tells me that you speak the Spanish language like a native.

No doubt he (Trysdale) had been guilty (he sometimes did such things) of airing at the club some old, canting Castilian proverb dug from the hotchpotch at the back of dictionaries. Carruthers, who was one of his incontinent admirers, was the very man to have magnified this exhibition of doubtful erudition. But, alas! the incense of her admiration had been so sweet and flattering. He allowed the imputation to pass without denial. Without protest, he allowed her to twine about his brow this spurious bay of Spanish scholarship. He let it grace his conquering head, and, among its soft convolutions, he did not feel the prick of the thorn that was to pierce him later."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"How glad, how shy, how tremulous she was!

The next day he waited, impatient, in his rooms for the word. At noon her groom came to the door and left the strange cactus in the red earthen jar. There was no note, no message, merely a tag upon the plant bearing a barbarous foreign or botanical name. He waited until night, but her answer did not come. His large pride and hurt vanity kept him from seeking her. Two evenings later they met at a dinner. Their greetings were conventional, but she looked at him, breathless, wondering, eager. He was courteous, adamant, waiting her explanation. With womanly swiftness she took her cue from his manner, and turned to snow and ice. Thus, and wider from this on, they had drifted apart. Where was his fault? Who had been to blame? Humbled now, he sought the answer amid the ruins of his self-conceit.

Look at me, another accessory, come two thousand miles on a garlicky, cockroachy banana steamer all the way from South America to connive at the sacrifice--please to observe how lightly my guilt rests upon my shoulders. Only little sister I had, too, and now she's gone. Come now! take something to ease your conscience.\\" \\"I don't drink just now, thanks,\\" said Trysdale. \\"Your brandy,\\" resumed the other, coming over and joining him, \\"is abominable.

25	\N	The Dinner Party	Mona Gardner	\N	t	t	[{"type":"title","content":"The Dinner Party"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The country is India.  A large dinner party is being given in an up-country station by a colonial official and his wife.  The guests are army officers and government attaches and their wives, and an American naturalist. At one side of the long table a spirited discussion springs  up between a young girl and a colonel.  The girl insists women have long outgrown the jumping-on-a-chair-at-the-sight-of-a-mouse  era, that they are not as fluttery as their grandmothers.  The colonel says they are, explaining women haven't the actual nerve control of men.  The other men at the table agree with him. \\"A woman's unfailing reaction in any crisis, \\" the colonel says, \\"is to scream.  And while a man may feel  like it, yet he  has that  ounce  more  of  control  than a woman has.  And that last ounce is what counts.\\" The American scientist does  not  join  in  the  argument but sits and watches the faces of the other guests. As he looks,  he  sees a strange expression come over the face of the hostess.  She  is staring  straight ahead,  the muscles of her face contracting  slightly.  With a small gesture she summons the native boy standing behind her chair.  She whispers to him.  The boy's eyes widen: he   turns quickly and leaves  the  room.  No one else sees this, nor the boy when he puts a bowl of milk on the verandah outside the glass doors. The American comes to with a start.  In India, milk in a bowl means only one thing.  It is bait  for a  snake.  He  realizes there is a cobra  in  the room. He  looks   up   at  the  rafters-the   likeliest   place - and sees they  are  bare.  Three corners of the  room, which he can see by shifting only slightly, are empty.  In the fourth corner a group of servants stand, waiting until the next course can be served.  The American realizes there is only one place left - under the table. His first impulse is to jump back and warn the others.  But he knows the commotion will frighten the cobra and it will strike.  He speaks quickly, the quality of his voice so arresting that it sobers everyone. \\"I want to know just what control everyone at this table has.  I will count three hundred - that's five minutes - and not one of you is to move a single muscle. The persons who move will forfeit 50 rupees.  Now!  Ready!\\" The 20 people sit like stone images while he counts. He is saying \\". . . two hundred and eighty . . .\\" when, out of the corner of his eye, he sees the cobra emerge and make for the bowl of milk.  Four or five screams ring out as he jumps to slam shut the verandah doors. \\"You certainly were right, Colonel!\\" the host says.  \\"A man has just shown us an example of real control.\\" \\"Just a minute,\\" the American says, turning to his hostess, \\"there's one thing I'd like to know.  Mrs. Wynnes, how did you know that cobra was in the room?\\" A faint smile lights up the woman's face as she replies.  \\"Because it was lying across my foot.\\""}]

With a view to providing herself with a male escort Mrs. Chemping had invited her youngest nephew to accompany her on the first day of the shopping expedition, throwing in the additional allurement of a cinematograph theatre and the prospect of light refreshment. As Cyprian was not yet eighteen she hoped he might not have reached that stage in masculine development when parcel-carrying is looked on as a thing abhorrent. \\"Meet me just outside the floral department,\\" she wrote to him, \\"and don't be a moment later than eleven.\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Cyprian was a boy who carried with him through early life the wondering look of a dreamer, the eyes of one who sees things that are not visible to ordinary mortals, and invests the commonplace things of this world with qualities unsuspected by plainer folk - the eyes of a poet or a house agent. He was quietly dressed - that sartorial quietude which frequently accompanies early adolescence, and is usually attributed by novel-writers to the influence of a widowed mother. His hair was brushed back in a smoothness as of ribbon seaweed and seamed with a narrow furrow that scarcely aimed at being a parting. His aunt particularly noted this item of his toilet when they met at the appointed rendezvous, because he was standing waiting for her bare-headed."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\\"Where is your hat?\\" she asked. \\"I didn't bring one with me,\\" he replied. Adela Chemping was slightly scandalised. \\"You are not going to be what they call a Nut, are you?\\" she inquired with some anxiety, partly with the idea that a Nut would be an extravagance which her sister's small household would scarcely be justified in incurring, partly, perhaps, with the instinctive apprehension that a Nut, even in its embryo stage, would refuse to carry parcels."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Cyprian looked at her with his wondering, dreamy eyes. \\"I didn't bring a hat,\\" he said, \\"because it is such a nuisance when one is shopping; I mean it is so awkward if one meets anyone one knows and has to take one's hat off when one's hands are full of parcels. If one hasn't got a hat on one can't take it off.\\" Mrs. Chemping sighed with great relief; her worst fear had been laid at rest. \\"It is more orthodox to wear a hat,\\" she observed, and then turned her attention briskly to the business in hand. \\"We will go first to the table-linen counter,\\" she said, leading the way in that direction; \\"I should like to look at some napkins.\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The wondering look deepened in Cyprian's eyes as he followed his aunt; he belonged to a generation that is supposed to be over-fond of the role of mere spectator, but looking at napkins that one did not mean to buy was a pleasure beyond his comprehension.

Like my rabbit, I would be most active in the hours around dawn and sunset. Salsal, on the other hand, would stay up late at night and wake up at midday. And before he even got out of bed he would open his laptop and log on to Facebook to check the latest comments on the previous night’s discussion, then eventually go and have a bath. After that he would go into the kitchen, turn on the radio and listen to the news while he fried an egg and made some coffee. He would carry his breakfast into the garden and sit at the table under the umbrella, eating and drinking and smoking as he watched me."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"“Good morning, Hajjar. What news of the flowers?”"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"“It’s been a hot year, so they won’t grow strong,” I told him, as I pruned the rose bushes."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Salsal lit another cigarette and gave my rabbit an ironic smile. I never understood why he was annoyed by the rabbit. The old woman Umm Dala had brought it. She said she found it in the park. We decided to keep it while Umm Dala looked for its owner. The rabbit had been with us for a month and I had already spent two months with Salsal in this fancy villa in the north of the Green Zone. The villa was detached, surrounded by a high wall and with a gate fitted with a sophisticated electronic security system. We didn’t know when zero hour would come. Salsal was a professional, whereas they called me duckling because this was my first operation."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Mr. Salman would visit us once a week to check how we were and reassure us about things. Mr. Salman would bring some bottles of booze and some hashish. He would always tell us a silly joke about politics and remind us how secret and important the operation was. This Salman was in league with Salsal and didn’t reveal many secrets to me. Both of them made much of my weakness and lack of experience. I didn’t pay them much attention. I was sunk in the bitterness of my life, and I wanted the world to be destroyed in one fell swoop."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Umm Dala would come two days a week. She would bring us cigarettes and clean the house. On one occasion Salsal harassed her. He touched her bottom while she was cooking dolma. She hit him on the nose with her spoon and made it bleed. Salsal laid off her and didn’t speak to her after that. She was an energetic woman in her fifties with nine children. She claimed she hated men, saying they were despicable, selfish pricks. Her husband had worked in the national electricity company, but he fell from the top of a lamppost and died. He was a drunkard and she used to call him the arrack gerbil."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I built the rabbit a hutch in the corner of the garden and took good care of him. I know rabbits are sensitive creatures and need to be kept clean and well-fed. I read about that when I was at secondary school. I developed a passion for reading when I was thirteen. In the beginning I read classical Arabic poetry and lots of stories translated from the Russian. But I soon grew bored. Our neighbor worked in the Ministry of Agriculture and one day I was playing with his son Salam on the roof of their house, when we came across a large wooden trunk up there with assorted junk piled up on top of it. Salam shared a secret with me. The trunk was crammed with books about crops and irrigation methods and countless encyclopaedias about plants and insects. Under the books there were lots of sex magazines with pictures of Turkish actresses. Salam gave me a magazine but I also took a book about the various types of palm tree that grow in the country. I didn’t need Salam after that. I would sneak from our house to the roof of theirs to visit the library in the trunk. I would take one book and one magazine and put back the ones I had borrowed. After that I fell in love with books about animals and plants and would hunt down every new book that reached the bookshops, until I was forced to join the army."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The pleasure I found in reading books was disconcerting, however. I felt anxious about every new piece of information. I would latch onto one particular detail and start looking for references and other versions of it in other writings. I remembered, for example, that for quite some time I tracked down the subject of kissing. I read and read and felt dizzy with the subject, as if I had eaten some psychotropic fruit. Experiments have shown that chimpanzees resort to kissing as a way to reduce tension, fatigue, and fear among the group. It’s been proven that female chimpanzees, when they feel that strangers have entered their territory, hurry to their mates, hug them and start kissing them. And after long research, I came across another kiss, a long tropical kiss. A kiss by a type of tropical fish that kiss each other for half an hour or more without any kind of break. My memory of those years of darkness under sanctions is of devouring books. The electricity would go off for up to twenty hours a day, especially after that series of U.S. air strikes on the presidential palaces. I would snuggle into bed at midnight and by the light of a candle I would stumble upon another species of kiss: by insects called reduvius, though they don’t actually kiss each other. These only like the mouths of sleeping humans. They crawl across the face till they reach the corner of the mouth, where they settle down and start kissing. When they kiss they secrete poison in microscopic drops, and if the person sleeping is in good health and sleeping normally, he’ll wake up with a poisonous kiss on his mouth the size of four large raindrops put together."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I ran away from military service. I couldn’t endure the system of humiliation there. At night I worked in a bakery. I had to support my mother and my five brothers. I lost the urge to read. For me the world became like an incomprehensible mythical animal. A year after I ran away, the regime was overthrown and I was free of my fear of punishment for my earlier desertion. The new government abolished conscription. When the cycle of violence and the sectarian decapitations began, I planned to escape the country and go to Europe, but then they massacred two of my remaining brothers. They were coming back from work in a local factory that made women’s shoes. The taxi driver handed them over at a fake checkpoint. The Allahu Akbar militias took them away to an undisclosed location. They drilled lots of holes in their bodies with an electric drill and then cut off their heads. We found their bodies in a rubbish dump on the edge of the city."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I was completely devastated and I left home. I couldn’t bear to see the horror on the faces of my mother and brothers. I felt lost and no longer knew what I still wanted from this life. I took a room in a dirty hotel until my uncle came to visit me and suggested I work with his sect. To exact revenge."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The summer days were long and tedious. It’s true that the villa was comfortable, with a swimming pool and a sauna. But to me it seemed like a palatial mirage. Salsal took a room on the second floor, while I was content with a cover and a pillow on the sofa in the middle of the large sitting room where the bookcase stood. I wanted to keep an eye on the garden and the outer gate of the villa, in case anything unexpected happened. I was stunned by the size of the bookcase in the sitting room. It had many volumes on religion and on local and international law. Along the shelves, animals made of teak had been arranged in shapes and poses reminiscent of African totems. The animals also separated the religious books from the law books. As soon as it fell dark, I would grab a bite to eat and go and surrender myself to the sofa, reminisce a little about the events of my life, then take out a book and read distractedly. The world in my head was like a spider’s web that made a faint hum, the hum of a life about to expire, of breaths held. Delicate, horrible wings flapping for the last time."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I found the egg three days before Mr. Salman’s last visit. One day I woke up at dawn as usual. I fetched some clean water and food and went to inspect my friend the rabbit. I opened his hutch and he hopped out into the garden. There was an egg in the hutch. I picked it up and examined it, trying to understand the absurdity of it. It was too small to be a chicken’s egg. I was anxious so I went straight to Salsal’s room. I woke him up and told him about it. Salsal took hold of the egg and stared at it for a while, then laughed sneeringly."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\\"Hajjar, you’d better not be pulling my leg,” he said, pointing his finger toward my eye."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"“What do you mean? It wasn’t me who laid the egg!” I said firmly."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Salsal rubbed his eyes, then suddenly jumped out of bed like a madman, firing curses at me. We headed to the villa gate and checked the security system. We inspected the walls and searched the garden and all the rooms. There were no signs of anything unusual. But an egg in a rabbit hutch! Our only option was to think that someone was playing tricks on us, sneaking into the villa and putting the egg next to the rabbit."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"“Perhaps it’s a silly stunt by that whore Umm Dala. Damn you and your rabbit,” said Salsal, but then went quiet."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Both of us knew that Umm Dala was sick and hadn’t come to visit us for the past week. We were doubly afraid because we didn’t have any guns in the house. We weren’t allowed to have guns until the day of the mission. They were worried about random searches because the Green Zone was a government area and most of the politicians lived there. We were living in the villa on the pretense that we were bodyguards to a member of parliament. Salsal threw a fit and asked me to slaughter the rabbit, but I refused and told him the rabbit had nothing to do with what had happened."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"“Wasn’t it your bloody rabbit that laid the egg?” he said angrily as he went up to his room."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I made some coffee and sat in the garden watching the rabbit, which was eating its own droppings. They say the droppings contain vitamin B produced by tiny organisms in its intestines. After a while Salsal came back carrying his laptop. He was mumbling to himself and cursing Mr. Salman from time to time. He looked at his Facebook page and said we had to be on alert 24-7. He asked me to spend the night in his room on the second floor because it was good for monitoring the gate and the walls of the villa."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"We turned off all the lights, sat in Salsal’s room and every now and then took turns making a tour of inspection around the villa."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Two nights passed without anything suspicious. The villa was quiet, sunk in silence and calm. While I was staying in Salsal’s room I learned he was registered with Facebook under the pseudonym War and Peace and had posted a charcoal drawing of Tolstoy as his profile picture. He had more than a thousand Facebook friends, most of them writers, journalists, and intellectuals. He would discuss their ideas and pose as an intelligent admirer of other Facebook people. He expressed his opinions and his analysis of the violence in the country with modesty and wisdom. He even tried it on with me, rambling on about the character of the Deputy Minister of Culture. He told me how cultured and humane and uniquely intelligent he was. At the time I wasn’t interested in talking about the deputy minister. I told him that people who work in our line of business ought to keep their distance from too much Internet chat. He gave me his sneering professional look and said, “You look after your egg-laying rabbit, Hajjar.”"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When Mr. Salman finally visited us, Salsal exploded in anger in front of him, and told him about the rabbit’s egg. Mr. Salman ridiculed our story and dismissed our suspicions of Umm Dala. He assured us the woman was honest and had worked with them for years. But Salsal accused him of betrayal and they began to argue, while I sat watching them. From their argument I gathered that in the world of sectarian and political assassinations, people were often betrayed because of greater interests. In many cases the parties in power would hand over hired killers to each other for free, as part of wider deals over political positions or to cover up some large-scale corruption. But Mr. Salman denied all Salsal’s accusations. He asked us to calm down, because the assassination of the target would take place in two days. We sat down in the kitchen and Salman explained the plan to us in detail. Then he took two revolvers with silencers out of his bag and said we would be paid right after the operation and that we would then be moved to somewhere else on the edge of the capital."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"“A rabbit’s egg. Ha, duckling. You’re a real joker now,” Salman whispered to me before he left."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"On the last night I stayed up late with Salsal. I was worried about the rabbit, because it looked like Umm Dala would be on a long holiday. The rabbit would die of hunger and thirst. Salsal was busy with Facebook as usual. I stayed close to the window, watching the garden. He said he was having a discussion with the Deputy Minister of Culture on sectarian violence and its roots. I gathered from Salsal that this minister had been a novelist in Saddam Hussein’s time and had written three novels about Sufism. One day he and his wife were at a party at the home of a wealthy architect overlooking the Tigris. His wife was attractive, stunningly so, and cultured like her husband. She had a particular interest in old Islamic manuscripts. The Director of Security, a relative of the president, was a guest at the party. After the party was over, the security chief gave his surveillance section orders to read our friend’s novels. A few days later they threw him in jail on charges of incitement against the State and the Party. The Director of Security bargained with the novelist’s wife in exchange for her husband’s freedom. When she rejected his demands, the security chief had one of his men rape the woman in front of her husband. After that the woman moved to France and disappeared. They released the novelist in the middle of the nineties and he went off to look for his wife in France, but could find no trace of her. When the dictator’s regime fell, he went home and was appointed Deputy Minister of Culture. The story of the novelist’s life was like the plot of a Bollywood film, but I was surprised how many details of the man’s life Salsal knew. I felt that he admired the man’s personality and sophistication. I asked him what sect the man was. He ignored my question. Then I tried to draw him out on the identity of our target, but Salsal replied that a novice duckling like me wasn’t allowed to know such things. My only task was to drive the car and it was Salsal who would fire the shot with his silenced revolver."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The next morning we were waiting in front of the parking lot in the city center. The target was meant to arrive in a red Toyota Crown and as soon as the car went into the lot Salsal would get out of our car, follow him inside on foot and shoot him.

That’s why I had brought the rabbit along with me and put it in the trunk of the car."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Salsal received a text on his cell phone and his face turned pale. We shouldn’t have had to wait for the target more than ten minutes. I asked him if all was well. He shouted a curse and slapped his thigh. I was worried.

It was a silly Photoshop job. “Do you know who sent the picture?” he asked."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I shook my head. “The Deputy Minister of Culture,” he said. “What!!?” “The deputy’s the target, Hajjar.”"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I got out of the car, my blood boiling at Salsal’s stupidity and all the craziness of this pathetic operation. More than a quarter of an hour passed and the target didn’t appear. I told Salsal I was pulling out of the operation. He got out of the car too and asked me to be patient and wait a while longer, because both of us were in danger. He got back in the car and tried to contact Salman. I walked to a shop nearby to buy a packet of cigarettes. My heart was pounding like crazy from the anger. As soon as I reached the shop the car blew up behind me and caught fire, burning the rabbit and Salsal to cinders."}]
28	\N	The Nightingale and the Rose	Oscar Wilde	The Nightingale and the Rose was first published in 1888 as part of Oscar Wilde's collection of children's stories entitled The Happy Prince and Other Tales.	t	f	[{"type":"title","content":"The Nightingale and the Rose"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\\"She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,\\" cried the young Student; \\"but in all my garden there is no red rose.\\"  From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered. \\"No red rose in all my garden!\\" he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears. \\"Ah, fon what little things does happiness depend! I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched.\\" \\"Here at last is a true lover,\\" said the Nightingale. \\"Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him. His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow.\\" \\"The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night,\\" murmured the young Student, \\"and my love will be of the company. If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn. If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine. But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by. She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break.\\" \\"Here indeed is the true lover,\\" said the Nightingale. \\"What I sing of, he suffers - what is joy to me, to him is pain. Surely Love is a wonderful thing. It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals. Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace. It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.\\" \\"The musicians will sit in their gallery,\\" said the young Student, \\"and play upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound of the harp and the violin. She will dance so lightly that her feet will not touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng round her. But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her\\"; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept. \\"Why is he weeping?\\" asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air. \\"Why, indeed?\\" said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a sunbeam. \\"Why, indeed?\\" whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice. \\"He is weeping for a red rose,\\" said the Nightingale. \\"For a red rose?\\" they cried; \\"how very ridiculous!\\" and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright. But the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student's sorrow, and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air. She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden. In the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray. \\"Give me a red rose,\\" she cried, \\"and I will sing you my sweetest song.\\" But the Tree shook its head. \\"My roses are white,\\" it answered; \\"as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain. But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want.\\" So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the old sun-dial. \\"Give me a red rose,\\" she cried, \\"and I will sing you my sweetest song.\\" But the Tree shook its head. \\"My roses are yellow,\\" it answered; \\"as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe. But go to my brother who grows beneath the Student's window, and perhaps he will give you what you want.\\" So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath the Student's window. \\"Give me a red rose,\\" she cried, \\"and I will sing you my sweetest song.\\" But the Tree shook its head. \\"My roses are red,\\" it answered, \\"as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern. But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year.\\" \\"One red rose is all I want,\\" cried the Nightingale, \\"only one red rose! Is there no way by which I can get it?\\" \\"There is a way,\\" answered the Tree; \\"but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you.\\" \\"Tell it to me,\\" said the Nightingale, \\"I am not afraid.\\" \\"If you want a red rose,\\" said the Tree, \\"you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart's-blood. You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn. All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine.\\" \\"Death is a great price to pay for a red rose,\\" cried the Nightingale, \\"and Life is very dear to all. It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl. Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill. Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air. She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through the grove. The young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him, and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes. \\"Be happy,\\" cried the Nightingale, \\"be happy; you shall have your red rose. I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my own heart's-blood. All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty. Flame- coloured are his wings, and coloured like flame is his body. His lips are sweet as honey, and his breath is like frankincense.\\" The Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the things that are written down in books. But the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches. \\"Sing me one last song,\\" he whispered; \\"I shall feel very lonely when you are gone.\\" So the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water bubbling from a silver jar. When she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book and a lead-pencil out of his pocket. \\"She has form,\\" he said to himself, as he walked away through the grove - \\"that cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling? I am afraid not. In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without any sincerity. She would not sacrifice herself for others. She thinks merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish. Still, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice. What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good.\\" And he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and began to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn. All night long she sang with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down and listened. All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her. She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl. And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous rose, petal following petal, as song followed song. Pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the river - pale as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn. As the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree. But the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn. \\"Press closer, little Nightingale,\\" cried the Tree, \\"or the Day will come before the rose is finished.\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of a man and a maid. And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride. But the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose's heart remained white, for only a Nightingale's heart's-blood can crimson the heart of a rose. And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn. \\"Press closer, little Nightingale,\\" cried the Tree, \\"or the Day will come before the rose is finished.\\" So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her. Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky. Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart. But the Nightingale's voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to beat, and a film came over her eyes. Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat. Then she gave one last burst of music. The white Moon heard it, and she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky. The red rose heard it, and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold morning air. Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke the sleeping shepherds from their dreams. It floated through the reeds of the river, and they carried its message to the sea. \\"Look, look!\\" cried the Tree, \\"the rose is finished now\\"; but the Nightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass, with the thorn in her heart."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And at noon the Student opened his window and looked out. \\"Why, what a wonderful piece of luck!\\" he cried; \\"here is a red rose! I have never seen any rose like it in all my life. It is so beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name\\"; and he leaned down and plucked it. Then he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor's house with the rose in his hand. The daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet. \\"You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose,\\" cried the Student. \\"Here is the reddest rose in all the world. You will wear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell you how I love you.\\" But the girl frowned. \\"I am afraid it will not go with my dress,\\" she answered; \\"and, besides, the Chamberlain's nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers.\\" \\"Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful,\\" said the Student angrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it. \\"Ungrateful!\\" said the girl. \\"I tell you what, you are very rude; and, after all, who are you? Only a Student. Why, I don't believe you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain's nephew has\\"; and she got up from her chair and went into the house. \\"What a silly thing Love is,\\" said the Student as he walked away. \\"It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true. In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.\\" So he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began to read."}]
29	\N	The Old Man at the Bridge	Ernest Hemingway	\N	t	f	[{"type":"title","content":"The Old Man at the Bridge"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"An old man with steel rimmed spectacles and very dusty clothes sat by the side of the road. There was a pontoon bridge across the river and carts, trucks, and men, women and children were crossing it. The mule- drawn carts staggered up the steep bank from the bridge with soldiers helping push against the spokes of the wheels. The trucks ground up and away heading out of it all and the peasants plodded along in the ankle deep dust. But the old man sat there without moving. He was too tired to go any farther. It was my business to cross the bridge, explore the bridgehead beyond and find out to what point the enemy had advanced. I did this and returned over the bridge. There were not so many carts now and very few people on foot, but the old man was still there. \\"Where do you come from?\\" I asked him. \\"From San Carlos,\\" he said, and smiled. That was his native town and so it gave him pleasure to mention it and he smiled. \\"I was taking care of animals,\\" he explained. \\"Oh,\\" I said, not quite understanding. \\"Yes,\\" he said, \\"I stayed, you see, taking care of animals. I was the last one to leave the town of San Carlos.\\" He did not look like a shepherd nor a herdsman and I looked at his black dusty clothes and his gray dusty face and his steel rimmed spectacles and said, \\"What animals were they?\\" \\"Various animals,\\" he said, and shook his head. \\"I had to leave them.\\" I was watching the bridge and the African looking country of the Ebro Delta and wondering how long now it would be before we would see the enemy, and listening all the while for the first noises that would signal that ever mysterious event called contact, and the old man still sat there. \\"What animals were they?\\" I asked. \\"There were three animals altogether,\\" he explained. \\"There were two goats and a cat and then there were four pairs of pigeons.\\" And you had to leave them?\\" I asked. \\"Yes. Because of the artillery. The captain told me to go because of the artillery.\\" \\"And you have no family?\\" I asked, watching the far end of the bridge where a few last carts were hurrying down the slope of the bank. \\"No,\\" he said, \\"only the animals I stated. The cat, of course, will be all right. A cat can look out for itself, but I cannot think what will become of the others.\\" \\"What politics have you?\\" I asked. \\"I am without politics,\\" he said. \\"I am seventy-six years old. I have come twelve kilometers now and I think now I can go no further.\\" \\"This is not a good place to stop,\\" I said. \\"If you can make it, there are trucks up the road where it forks for Tortosa.\\" \\"I will wait a while,\\" he said, \\" and then I will go. Where do the trucks go?\\" \\"Towards Barcelona,\\" I told him. \\"I know no one in that direction,\\" he said, \\"but thank you very much. Thank you again very much.\\" He looked at me very blankly and tiredly, and then said, having to share his worry with someone, \\"The cat will be all right, I am sure. There is no need to be unquiet about the cat. But the others. Now what do you think about the others?\\" \\"Why they'll probably come through it all right.\\" \\"You think so?\\" \\"Why not,\\" I said, watching the far bank where now there were no carts. \\"But what will they do under the artillery when I was told to leave because of the artillery?\\" \\"Did you leave the dove cage unlocked?\\" I asked. \\"Yes.\\" \\"Then they'll fly.\\" \\"Yes, certainly they'll fly. But the others. It's better not to think about the others,\\" he said. \\"If you are rested I would go,\\" I urged. \\"Get up and try to walk now.\\" \\"Thank you,\\" he said and got to his feet, swayed from side to side and then sat down backwards in the dust. \\"I was taking care of animals,\\" he said dully, but no longer to me. \\"I was only taking care of animals.\\" There was nothing to do about him. It was Easter Sunday and the Fascists were advancing toward the Ebro. It was a gray overcast day with a low ceiling so their planes were not up. That and the fact that cats know how to look after themselves was all the good luck that old man would ever have."}]

It was her sister Josephine who told her, in broken sentences; veiled hints that revealed in half concealing. Her husband's friend Richards was there, too, near her. It was he who had been in the newspaper office when intelligence of the railroad disaster was received, with Brently Mallard's name leading the list of \\"killed.\\" He had only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by a second telegram, and had hastened to forestall any less careful, less tender friend in bearing the sad message."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"She did not hear the story as many women have heard the same, with a paralyzed inability to accept its significance. She wept at once, with sudden, wild abandonment, in her sister's arms. When the storm of grief had spent itself she went away to her room alone. She would have no one follow her."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There stood, facing the open window, a comfortable, roomy armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach into her soul."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the street below a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant song which someone was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There were patches of blue sky showing here and there through the clouds that had met and piled one above the other in the west facing her window. She sat with her head thrown back upon the cushion of the chair, quite motionless, except when a sob came up into her throat and shook her, as a child who has cried itself to sleep continues to sob in its dreams."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"She was young, with a fair, calm face, whose lines bespoke repression and even a certain strength. But now there was a dull stare in her eyes, whose gaze was fixed away off yonder on one of those patches of blue sky. It was not a glance of reflection, but rather indicated a suspension of intelligent thought."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully. What was it? She did not know; it was too subtle and elusive to name. But she felt it, creeping out of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds, the scents, the color that filled the air."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now her bosom rose and fell tumultuously. She was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her, and she was striving to beat it back with her will--as powerless as her two white slender hands would have been. When she abandoned herself a little whispered word escaped her slightly parted lips. She said it over and over under the breath: \\"free, free, free!\\" The vacant stare and the look of terror that had followed it went from her eyes. They stayed keen and bright. Her pulses beat fast, and the coursing blood warmed and relaxed every inch of her body."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"She did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her. A clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial. She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow-creature. A kind intention or a cruel intention made the act seem no less a crime as she looked upon it in that brief moment of illumination."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And yet she had loved him--sometimes.

What could love, the unsolved mystery, count for in the face of this possession of self-assertion which she suddenly recognized as the strongest impulse of her being!"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\\"Free! Body and soul free!\\" she kept whispering. Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the keyhole, imploring for admission. \\"Louise, open the door! I beg; open the door--you will make yourself ill. What are you doing, Louise? For heaven's sake open the door.\\" \\"Go away. I am not making myself ill.\\" No; she was drinking in a very elixir of life through that open window. Her fancy was running riot along those days ahead of her. Spring days, and summer days, and all sorts of days that would be her own. She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long. It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might be long."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"She arose at length and opened the door to her sister's importunities. There was a feverish triumph in her eyes, and she carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory. She clasped her sister's waist, and together they descended the stairs. Richards stood waiting for them at the bottom. Someone was opening the front door with a latchkey. It was Brently Mallard who entered, a little travel-stained, composedly carrying his grip-sack and umbrella. He had been far from the scene of the accident, and did not even know there had been one. He stood amazed at Josephine's piercing cry; at Richards' quick motion to screen him from the view of his wife. When the doctors came they said she had died of heart disease--of the joy that kills."}]

The thrushes were calling, and in the swamps close by something alive droned pitifully with a sound like blowing into an empty bottle. A snipe flew by, and the shot aimed at it rang out with a gay, resounding note in the spring air. But when it began to get dark in the forest a cold, penetrating wind blew inappropriately from the east, and everything sank into silence. Needles of ice stretched across the pools, and it felt cheerless, remote, and lonely in the forest. There was a whiff of winter."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Ivan Velikopolsky, the son of a sacristan, and a student of the clerical academy, returning home from shooting, kept walking on the path by the water-logged meadows. His fingers were numb and his face was burning with the wind. It seemed to him that the cold that had suddenly come on had destroyed the order and harmony of things, that nature itself felt ill at ease, and that was why the evening darkness was falling more rapidly than usual. All around it was deserted and peculiarly gloomy. The only light was one gleaming in the widows' gardens near the river; the village, over three miles away, and everything in the distance all round was plunged in the cold evening mist. The student remembered that, as he had left the house, his mother was sitting barefoot on the floor in the entryway, cleaning the samovar, while his father lay on the stove coughing; as it was Good Friday nothing had been cooked, and the student was terribly hungry. And now, shrinking from the cold, he thought that just such a wind had blown in the days of Rurik and in the time of Ivan the Terrible and Peter, and in their time there had been just the same desperate poverty and hunger, the same thatched roofs with holes in them, ignorance, misery, the same desolation around, the same darkness, the same feeling of oppression -- all these had existed, did exist, and would exist, and the lapse of a thousand years would make life no better. And he did not want to go home."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The gardens were called the widows' because they were kept by two widows, mother and daughter. A campfire was burning brightly with a crackling sound, throwing out light far around on the ploughed earth. The widow Vasilisa, a tall, fat old woman in a man's coat, was standing by and looking thoughtfully into the fire; her daughter Lukerya, a little pockmarked woman with a stupid-looking face, was sitting on the ground, washing a cauldron and spoons. Apparently they had just had supper. There was a sound of men's voices; it was the laborers watering their horses at the river."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\\"Here you have winter back again,\\" said the student, going up to the campfire. \\"Good evening.\\" Vasilisa started, but at once recognized him and smiled cordially. \\"I did not know you; God bless you,\\" she said. \\"You'll be rich.\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"They talked. Vasilisa, a woman of experience who had been in service with the gentry, first as a wet-nurse, afterwards as a children's nurse expressed herself with refinement, and a soft, sedate smile never left her face; her daughter Lukerya, a village peasant woman who had been beaten by her husband, simply screwed up her eyes at the student and said nothing, and she had a strange expression like that of a deaf-mute."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\\"At just such a fire the Apostle Peter warmed himself,\\" said the student, stretching out his hands to the fire, \\"so it must have been cold then, too. Ah, what a terrible night it must have been, granny! An utterly dismal long night!\\" He looked round at the darkness, shook his head abruptly and asked: \\"No doubt you have heard the reading of the Twelve Apostles?\\" \\"Yes, I have,\\" answered Vasilisa."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\\"If you remember, at the Last Supper Peter said to Jesus, 'I am ready to go with Thee into darkness and unto death.' And our Lord answered him thus: 'I say unto thee, Peter, before the cock croweth thou wilt have denied Me thrice.' After the supper Jesus went through the agony of death in the garden and prayed, and poor Peter was weary in spirit and faint, his eyelids were heavy and he could not struggle against sleep. He fell asleep. Then you heard how Judas the same night kissed Jesus and betrayed Him to His tormentors. They took Him bound to the high priest and beat Him, while Peter, exhausted, worn out with misery and alarm, hardly awake, you know, feeling that something awful was just going to happen on earth, followed behind. . . . He loved Jesus passionately, intensely, and now he saw from far off how He was beaten. . . . \\" Lukerya left the spoons and fixed an immovable stare upon the student."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\\"They came to the high priest's,\\" he went on; \\"they began to question Jesus, and meantime the laborers made a fire in the yard as it was cold, and warmed themselves. Peter, too, stood with them near the fire and warmed himself as I am doing. A woman, seeing him, said: 'He was with Jesus, too' -- that is as much as to say that he, too, should be taken to be questioned. And all the laborers that were standing near the fire must have looked sourly and suspiciously at him, because he was confused and said: 'I don't know Him.' A little while after again someone recognized him as one of Jesus' disciples and said: 'Thou, too, art one of them,' but again he denied it. And for the third time someone turned to him: 'Why, did I not see thee with Him in the garden today?' For the third time he denied it. And immediately after that time the cock crowed, and Peter, looking from afar off at Jesus, remembered the words He had said to him in the evening. . . . He remembered, he came to himself, went out of the yard and wept bitterly -- bitterly. In the Gospel it is written: 'He went out and wept bitterly.' I imagine it: the still, still, dark, dark garden, and in the stillness, faintly audible, smothered sobbing.. . . .\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The student sighed and sank into thought.

A cruel wind was blowing, winter really had come back and it did not feel as though Easter would be the day after tomorrow."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now the student was thinking about Vasilisa: since she had shed tears all that had happened to Peter the night before the Crucifixion must have some relation to her. . . . He looked round. The solitary light was still gleaming in the darkness and no figures could be seen near it now. The student thought again that if Vasilisa had shed tears, and her daughter had been troubled, it was evident that what he had just been telling them about, which had happened nineteen centuries ago, had a relation to the present -- to both women, to the desolate village, to himself, to all people. The old woman had wept, not because he could tell the story touchingly, but because Peter was near to her, because her whole being was interested in what was passing in Peter's soul."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And joy suddenly stirred in his soul, and he even stopped for a minute to take breath. \\"The past,\\" he thought, \\"is linked with the present by an unbroken chain of events flowing one out of another.\\" And it seemed to him that he had just seen both ends of that chain; that when he touched one end the other quivered."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When he crossed the river by the ferryboat and afterwards, mounting the hill, looked at his village and towards the west where the cold crimson sunset lay a narrow streak of light, he thought that truth and beauty which had guided human life there in the garden and in the yard of the high priest had continued without interruption to this day, and had evidently always been the chief thing in human life and in all earthly life, indeed; and the feeling of youth, health, vigor -- he was only twenty-two -- and the inexpressible sweet expectation of happiness, of unknown mysterious happiness, took possession of him little by little, and life seemed to him enchanting, marvellous, and full of lofty meaning."}]

The wretch often disguises himself, but he may always be known by his hoarse voice and black paws.\\" - \\"Dear mother,\\" answered the kids, \\"you need not be afraid, we will take good care of ourselves.\\" And the mother bleated good-bye, and went on her way with an easy mind."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It was not long before some one came knocking at the house-door, and crying out: \\"Open the door, my dear children, your mother is come back, and has brought each of you something.\\" But the little kids knew it was the wolf by the hoarse voice. \\"We will not open the door,\\" cried they; \\"you are not our mother, she has a delicate and sweet voice, and your voice is hoarse; you must be the wolf.\\" Then off went the wolf to a shop and bought a big lump of chalk, and ate it up to make his voice soft. And then he came back, knocked at the house-door, and cried: \\"Open the door, my dear children, your mother is here, and has brought each of you something.\\" But the wolf had put up his black paws against the window, and the kids seeing this, cried out, \\"We will not open the door; our mother has no black paws like you; you must be the wolf.\\" The wolf then ran to a baker. \\"Baker,\\" said he, \\"I am hurt in the foot; pray spread some dough over the place.\\" And when the baker had plastered his feet, he ran to the miller. \\"Miller,\\" said he, \\"strew me some white meal over my paws.\\" But the miller refused, thinking the wolf must be meaning harm to some one. \\"If you don't do it,\\" cried the wolf, \\"I'll eat you up!\\" And the miller was afraid and did as he was told. And that just shows what men are."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And now came the rogue the third time to the door and knocked. \\"Open, children!\\" cried he. \\"Your dear mother has come home, and brought you each something from the wood.\\" - \\"First show us your paws,\\" said the kids, \\"so that we may know if you are really our mother or not.\\" And he put up his paws against the window, and when they saw that they were white, all seemed right, and they opened the door. And when he was inside they saw it was the wolf, and they were terrified and tried to hide themselves. One ran under the table, the second got into the bed, the third into the oven, the fourth in the kitchen, the fifth in the cupboard, the sixth under the sink, the seventh in the clock-case. But the wolf found them all, and gave them short shrift; one after the other he swallowed down, all but the youngest, who was hid in the clock-case. And so the wolf, having got what he wanted, strolled forth into the green meadows, and laying himself down under a tree, he fell asleep."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Not long after, the mother goat came back from the wood; and, oh! what a sight met her eyes! the door was standing wide open, table, chairs, and stools, all thrown about, dishes broken, quilt and pillows torn off the bed. She sought her children, they were nowhere to be found. She called to each of them by name, but nobody answered, until she came to the name of the youngest. \\"Here I am, mother,\\" a little voice cried, \\"here, in the clock case.\\" And so she helped him out, and heard how the wolf had come, and eaten all the rest. And you may think how she cried for the loss of her dear children."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"At last in her grief she wandered out of doors, and the youngest kid with her; and when they came into the meadow, there they saw the wolf lying under a tree, and snoring so that the branches shook. The mother goat looked at him carefully on all sides and she noticed how something inside his body was moving and struggling. Dear me! thought she, can it be that my poor children that he devoured for his evening meal are still alive? And she sent the little kid back to the house for a pair of shears, and needle, and thread. Then she cut the wolf's body open, and no sooner had she made one snip than out came the head of one of the kids, and then another snip, and then one after the other the six little kids all jumped out alive and well, for in his greediness the rogue had swallowed them down whole. How delightful this was! so they comforted their dear mother and hopped about like tailors at a wedding. \\"Now fetch some good hard stones,\\" said the mother, \\"and we will fill his body with them, as he lies asleep.\\" And so they fetched some in all haste, and put them inside him, and the mother sewed him up so quickly again that he was none the wiser."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When the wolf at last awoke, and got up, the stones inside him made him feel very thirsty, and as he was going to the brook to drink, they struck and rattled one against another. And so he cried out: \\"What is this I feel inside me Knocking hard against my bones? How should such a thing betide me! They were kids, and now they're stones.\\" So he came to the brook, and stooped to drink, but the heavy stones weighed him down, so he fell over into the water and was drowned. And when the seven little kids saw it they came up running. \\"The wolf is dead, the wolf is dead!\\" they cried, and taking hands, they danced with their mother all about the place."}]
33	\N	The Zebra StoryTeller	Spencer Holst	\N	t	t	[{"type":"title","content":"The Zebra StoryTeller"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Once upon a time there was a Siamese cat who pretended to be a lion and spoke inappropriate Zebraic. That language is whinnied by the race of striped horses in Africa. Here now: An innocent zebra is walking in a jungle, and approaching from another direction is the little cat; they meet. “Hello there!” says the Siamese cat in perfectly pronounced Zebraic. “It certainly is a pleasant day, isn’t it? The sun is shining, the birds are singing, isn’t the world a lovely place to live today!” The zebra is so astonished at hearing a Siamese cat speaking like a zebra, why, he’s just fit to be tied. So the little cat quickly ties him up, kills him, and drags the better parts of the carcass back to his den. The cat successfully hunted zebras many months in this manner, dining on filet mignon of zebra every night, and from the better hides he made bow neckties and wide belts after the fashion of the decadent princes of the Old Siamese court. He began boasting to his friends he was a lion, and he gave them as proof the fact that he hunted zebras. The delicate noses of the zebras told them there was really no lion in the neighborhood. The zebra deaths caused many to avoid the region. Superstitious, they decided the woods were haunted by the ghost of a lion. One day the storyteller of the zebras was ambling, and through his mind ran plots for stories to amuse the other zebras, when suddenly his eyes brightened, and he said, “That’s it! I’ll tell a story about a Siamese cat who learns to speak our language! What an idea! That’ll make ’em laugh!” Just then the Siamese cat appeared before him, and said, “Hello there! Pleasant day today, isn’t it!” The zebra storyteller wasn’t fit to be tied at hearing a cat speaking his language, because he’d been thinking about that very thing. He took a good look at the cat, and he didn’t know why, but there was something about his looks he didn’t like, so he kicked him with a hoof and killed him. That is the function of the storyteller."}]

They're made out of meat.\\" \\"Meat?\\" \\"There's no doubt about it. We picked several from different parts of the planet, took them aboard our recon vessels, probed them all the way through. They're completely meat.\\" \\"That's impossible. What about the radio signals? The messages to the stars.\\" \\"They use the radio waves to talk, but the signals don't come from them. The signals come from machines.\\" \\"So who made the machines? That's who we want to contact.\\" \\"They made the machines. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Meat made the machines.\\" \\"That's ridiculous. How can meat make a machine? You're asking me to believe in sentient meat.\\" \\"I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. These creatures are the only sentient race in the sector and they're made out of meat.\\" \\"Maybe they're like the Orfolei. You know, a carbon-based intelligence that goes through a meat stage.\\" \\"Nope. They're born meat and they die meat. We studied them for several of their life spans, which didn't take too long. Do you have any idea the life span of meat?\\" \\"Spare me. Okay, maybe they're only part meat. You know, like the Weddilei. A meat head with an electron plasma brain inside.\\" \\"Nope. We thought of that, since they do have meat heads like the Weddilei. But I told you, we probed them. They're meat all the way through.\\" \\"No brain?\\" \\"Oh, there is a brain all right. It's just that the brain is made out of meat!\\" \\"So... what does the thinking?\\" \\"You're not understanding, are you? The brain does the thinking. The meat.\\" \\"Thinking meat! You're asking me to believe in thinking meat!\\" \\"Yes, thinking meat! Conscious meat! Loving meat. Dreaming meat. The meat is the whole deal! Are you getting the picture?\\" \\"Omigod. You're serious then. They're made out of meat.\\" \\"Finally, Yes. They are indeed made out meat. And they've been trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years.\\" \\"So what does the meat have in mind.\\" \\"First it wants to talk to us. Then I imagine it wants to explore the universe, contact other sentients, swap ideas and information. The usual.\\" \\"We're supposed to talk to meat?\\" \\"That's the idea. That's the message they're sending out by radio. 'Hello. Anyone out there? Anyone home?' That sort of thing.\\" \\"They actually do talk, then. They use words, ideas, concepts?\\" \\"Oh, yes. Except they do it with meat.\\" \\"I thought you just told me they used radio.\\" \\"They do, but what do you think is on the radio? Meat sounds. You know how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise? They talk by flapping their meat at each other. They can even sing by squirting air through their meat.\\" \\"Omigod. Singing meat. This is altogether too much. So what do you advise?\\" \\"Officially or unofficially?\\" \\"Both.\\" \\"Officially, we are required to contact, welcome, and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in the quadrant, without prejudice, fear, or favor. Unofficially, I advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing.\\" \\"I was hoping you would say that.\\" \\"It seems harsh, but there is a limit. Do we really want to make contact with meat?\\" \\"I agree one hundred percent. What's there to say?\\" `Hello, meat. How's it going?' But will this work? How many planets are we dealing with here?\\" \\"Just one. They can travel to other planets in special meat containers, but they can't live on them. And being meat, they only travel through C space. Which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim. Infinitesimal, in fact.\\" \\"So we just pretend there's no one home in the universe.\\" \\"That's it.\\" \\"Cruel. But you said it yourself, who wants to meet meat? And the ones who have been aboard our vessels, the ones you have probed? You're sure they won't remember?\\" \\"They'll be considered crackpots if they do. We went into their heads and smoothed out their meat so that we're just a dream to them.\\" \\"A dream to meat! How strangely appropriate, that we should be meat's dream.\\" \\"And we can marked this sector unoccupied.\\" \\"Good. Agreed, officially and unofficially. Case closed. Any others? Anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy?\\" \\"Yes, a rather shy but sweet hydrogen core cluster intelligence in a class nine star in G445 zone. Was in contact two galactic rotation ago, wants to be friendly again.\\" \\"They always come around.\\" \\"And why not? Imagine how unbearably, how unutterably cold the universe would be if one were all alone.\\""}]

May I wish you good health and good fortune in the future. I hope that graduation day will always bring back happy memories."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Honorary Graduates - The University of Nottingham, in common with other universities in Britain, is empowered by its Charter to confer honorary degrees on persons of distinction and those who have rendered great service to the University. Over the years since the granting of the Royal Charter in 1948, honorary graduates, starting with the first Chancellor, Lord Trent, have included politicians, musicians, men and women of letters, scientists, industrialists, lawyers, sporting personalities, all subsequent Chancellors and Vice-Chancellors and several long-serving senior employees of the University. The award of an honorary degree is the highest honour a University can bestow and may, in the case of Nottingham, be either a Master's Degree (Master of Arts, Master of Laws), or a Doctorate (of Divinity, Laws, Letters, Music, Science or Medicine). The actual degree awarded to an individual will be that which is most appropriate to his or her background and experience and carries with it all the rights and privileges of membership of the University. Before each honorary degree is awarded by the Chancellor, the candidate is presented by a senior member of the academic staff known as the Public Orator. In the speech, the public orator will highlight the major features of the honorary graduand's career, particularly those which have led to eminence and the reasons why the University is bestowing the honour. Anthony CLEAVER , Chairman and Chief Executive of IBM United Kingdom Holdings Limited, will receive the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LLD). Mr Cleaver joined IBM in 1962. In 1988 he became a member of the Board of Business in the Community. Roger GODFREY , President of the Council of the University of Nottingham, will receive the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LLD). He graduated from the University with an LLB in 1950 and is a partner in a solicitors' practice in Nottingham. Sir Charles MACKERRAS , Musical Director of Welsh National Opera, will receive the honorary degree of Doctor of Music (DMus). Sir Charles' career has included many periods conducting many of the world's major orchestras. Iona OPIE , the oral historian of childhood and, with her husband, of many books including Lore and Language of Schoolchildren (1959),The Oxford Book of Children's Verse (1973), and A Nursery Companion (1980), will receive the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters (DLitt). Jonathon PORRITT , campaigner on green issues, will receive the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LLD). He began his career as a teacher and is former Director of Friends of the Earth. Professor William STEWART , Chief Scientific Adviser to the Cabinet Office, will receive the honorary degree of Doctor of Science (DSc). Professor Stewart has been Secretary and Deputy Chairman of the Agricultural and Food Research Council since 1988. He was Head of the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Dundee between 1968 and 1983, and is internationally renowned for his work on nitrogen fixation in plants. Professor David WILLIAMS , Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, will receive the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LLD). Professor Williams has been Rouse Hall Professor of English Law at the University of Cambridge since 1983 and President of Wolfson College since 1980."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Ceremony - Today's Graduation Ceremony is a twentieth century version of a tradition which has its origins in medieval times. The modern ceremony contains only vestiges of the original Latin in such phrases as in absentia , for candidates graduating in their absence and honoris causa , applied to honorary degrees. Degrees are still however conferred by the Chancellor, whose title dates back to pre-Reformation days and whose authority is represented by the University Mace. A further modified survival from the medieval period is the academic dress of gown, hat and hood worn by graduates, University Officers and members of the academic procession. The varying colours of the gowns and hoods, and the more subtle variations in their style and cut, indicate the degree (Bachelor, Master or Doctor), the University which awarded the degree and even the faculty or subject. Further colour and splendour is brought to the occasion by the gold trimmed gowns and hats of the senior University officers: the Pro-Chancellors, the Vice-Chancellor and the Chancellor, whose gown has a long heavy train carried by his page. The procession which opens the ceremony includes academic staff of the University, Deans of Faculties, Pro-Vice-Chancellors, Honorary Graduands and Public Orators, the Senior Officers and finally the University Marshal, Esquire Bedell (the Mace-Bearer) and the Chancellor. Each ceremony usually starts with the presentation of one or more honorary graduands who are introduced by speeches from the public orators and then admitted to their degrees by the Chancellor. Thereafter each student passes before the Chancellor, who says ‘I admit you’ and at that moment the student changes from being a graduand (one who has satisfied all the requirements for a degree) to a graduate (one who has been admitted to the degree and is entitled to the privileges thereof including use of the designatory letters, e.g. BA, MSc or PhD). Students who are not able to be present are admitted to their degrees in absentia. At the end of the ceremony, the procession leaves the hall in reverse order, led by the Mace-Bearer and the Chancellor."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The University Past and Present - A rowing boat on the lake at Highfields Park is an excellent vantage point from which to view the building that most clearly evokes the University of Nottingham. The Trent Building, with its clock tower and sonorous chime, was, at its opening in 1928, a university in miniature. There were laboratories and lecture rooms, a library, a refectory, a ballroom and a theatre. This was an elegant and substantial location for higher education but it was to be only the beginning. Today the activities of 9,000 students and 1,000 staff are accommodated not only in the parkland campus of 330 acres surrounding the Trent Building but also within the adjacent Medical School and University Hospital and in the Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences some 10 miles to the south. It was over 60 years ago that Sir Jesse Boot (later Lord Trent), founder of the Boots Company, made a magnificent gift of land and money which enabled the University College to move from Nottingham town centre. Much later the Boots Pure Drug Co. endowed professorships in honour of Lord and Lady Trent which made a substantial contribution to the academic growth of the University. Other generous donations include those received form the Cripps family. They have endowed professorships and buildings, most notably Cripps Hall of Residence and Cripps Health Centre. Major expansion followed the granting of the Royal Charter in 1948. The monumental Portland Building rose in the early 1950s and teaching and residential accommodation space grew rapidly in the 1960s and 70s to keep pace with the growing demand for university places. A major new library opened in 1973 and soon afterwards Nottingham was proud to open the first Medical School to be established in Britain this century. In more recent years new buildings have included the Computing Centre, the Institute of German, Austrian and Swiss Affairs, research accommodation both at University Park and at the School of Agriculture, and further student residences. A new Arts Centre is nearing completion at the South Entrance. The growth of the University reflects the country's confidence in its contribution to education and research. Here at Nottingham it is recognized that the source of our special contribution to academic achievement is the quality of the people who work within it. The interaction of the enquiring and critical minds of students and staff, the pursuit of ideas and the desire to move forward the boundaries of knowledge are the hallmarks of higher education. The University has many staff whose work of outstanding international merit in many diverse fields has brought it great acclaim. Today pioneering work is being carried out in every faculty: engineers work on the motor car engine — botanists on plant breeding — physicists on the production of images of the soft tissue of the human body using revolutionary new techniques — social scientists on the political development of Eastern Europe and on computer systems which mimic human experts — literary scholars produce new insights into the works of major writers. The University is abounding with ideas which have been shared with those who have studied there. Growth is once again the watchword as the country looks for another period of expansion in higher education. Radical changes in the way education is delivered and increasing competition for scarce resources are some of the challenges universities will face in the years ahead. The University of Nottingham is meeting these challenges by maintaining its commitment to the highest quality teaching and research."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Student Life - Ask any university graduate a few years on what they best remember from their student days and the answer is unlikely to be anything to do with their course. Important as the academic qualifications are, university is as much about education in the wider sense of the term as it is about lectures, essays and exams. In this the University of Nottingham Union plays a central role, either running or being connected with almost all of students' extra curricular activities. On offer are over 150 clubs and societies ranging from Gliding to Gilbert and Sullivan and from Animal Welfare to Chess. For those with a competitive mind, all major sports are represented as are several up and coming ones, like Bat Polo and Korfball. Much students' time is also spent helping others. Through Community Action, over 1,000 students are involved in areas of work with the local community such as running a shelter for the homeless or teaching an adult to read. Karnival, another high profile area of the Students' Union, concentrates its work on fund raising and in the last year raised over £100,000 for various charities. If, as is so often said, one of the most important parts of life is getting on with people, our years at Nottingham University have certainly prepared us well!"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Beyond Graduation Day - Congratulations to all graduates and welcome to membership of a special group of people of a wide variety of ages and careers, in all parts of the world who share with you the experience of studying at this University. Nottingham Graduates have always been proud of their association with the University and you will find a special welcome form them wherever you go and whatever you do in the future. When you leave Nottingham you take with you enduring memories and friendships. We hope that you will build upon these so as to form a continuing association with your University. You can do this through the many Hall and Department associations, through clubs and groups at home and abroad. You will soon be receiving your free copy of the graduate newspaper to keep you up to date with the University, your contemporaries and the graduate associations.
