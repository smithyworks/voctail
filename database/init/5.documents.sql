I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men`s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high - power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion."}]
2	\N	Canada unit major offer accepted by union	Unknown journalist	Article from Oct 19 1987, Toronto	t	f	[{"type":"title","content":"Canada unit major offer accepted by union"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Canadian Auto Workers' Union said it accepted an economic offer from the Canadian division of General Motors Corp &lt;GM> in contract negotiations. But union president Bob White said many local issues at the 11 plants in Ontario and Quebec still remained unresolved ahead of Thursday's deadline for a strike by 40,000 workers. \\"It minimizes the possibility of a strike,\\" White told reporters. However, \\"if we don't have local agreements settled by Thursday, there will be a strike,\\" he said. The local issues still unresolved involved health care, skilled trades and job classifications, White said. GM Canada negotiator Rick Curd said he believed a strike would be avoided. \\"Even though there are some tough issues to be resolved we're on the right schedule to meet the target,\\" Curd said. \\"I'm very pleased with the state of the negotiations,\\" he said. Union membership meetings have been scheduled for the weekend in case a tentative settlement, said White. White said the union has also received assurances that a job protection pact negotiated with GM workers in the U.S. does not threaten Canadian jobs. The economic offer for a three-year pact largely matches agreements at Ford and Chrysler in Canada, which include inflation-indexed payments for future retirees and fixed annual payments for current retirees. It also gives workers wage increases of three pct immediately and 1.5 pct in each of the second and third years."}]

The maiden went every day to her mother's grave and wept, and was always pious and good. When the winter came the snow covered the grave with a white covering, and when the sun came in the early spring and melted it away, the man took to himself another wife."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The new wife brought two daughters home with her, and they were beautiful and fair in appearance, but at heart were, black and ugly. And then began very evil times for the poor step-daughter. \\"Is the stupid creature to sit in the same room with us?\\" said they; \\"those who eat food must earn it. Out upon her for a kitchen-maid!\\" They took away her pretty dresses, and put on her an old grey kirtle, and gave her wooden shoes to wear. \\"Just look now at the proud princess, how she is decked out!\\" cried they laughing, and then they sent her into the kitchen. There she was obliged to do heavy work from morning to night, get up early in the morning, draw water, make the fires, cook, and wash. Besides that, the sisters did their utmost to torment her, mocking her, and strewing peas and lentils among the ashes, and setting her to pick them up. In the evenings, when she was quite tired out with her hard day's work, she had no bed to lie on, but was obliged to rest on the hearth among the cinders. And as she always looked dusty and dirty, they named her Cinderella."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It happened one day that the father went to the fair, and he asked his two step-daughters what he should bring back for them. \\"Fine clothes!\\" said one. \\"Pearls and jewels!\\" said the other. \\"But what will you have, Cinderella?\\" said he. \\"The first twig, father, that strikes against your hat on the way home; that is what I should like you to bring me.\\" So he bought for the two step-daughters fine clothes, pearls, and jewels, and on his way back, as he rode through a green lane, a hazel-twig struck against his hat; and he broke it off and carried it home with him. And when he reached home he gave to the step-daughters what they had wished for, and to Cinderella he gave the hazel-twig. She thanked him, and went to her mother's grave, and planted this twig there, weeping so bitterly that the tears fell upon it and watered it, and it flourished and became a fine tree. Cinderella went to see it three times a day, and wept and prayed, and each time a white bird rose up from the tree, and if she uttered any wish the bird brought her whatever she had wished for."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now if came to pass that the king ordained a festival that should last for three days, and to which all the beautiful young women of that country were bidden, so that the king's son might choose a bride from among them. When the two stepdaughters heard that they too were bidden to appear, they felt very pleased, and they called Cinderella, and said, \\"Comb our hair, brush our shoes, and make our buckles fast, we are going to the wedding feast at the king's castle.\\" Cinderella, when she heard this, could not help crying, for she too would have liked to go to the dance, and she begged her step-mother to allow her. \\"What, you Cinderella!\\" said she, \\"in all your dust and dirt, you want to go to the festival! you that have no dress and no shoes! you want to dance!\\" But as she persisted in asking, at last the step-mother said, \\"I have strewed a dish-full of lentils in the ashes, and if you can pick them all up again in two hours you may go with us.\\" Then the maiden went to the backdoor that led into the garden, and called out, \\"O gentle doves, O turtle-doves, And all the birds that be, The lentils that in ashes lie Come and pick up for me!"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The good must be put in the dish, The bad you may eat if you wish.\\" Then there came to the kitchen-window two white doves, and after them some turtle-doves, and at last a crowd of all the birds under heaven, chirping and fluttering, and they alighted among the ashes; and the doves nodded with their heads, and began to pick, peck, pick, peck, and then all the others began to pick, peck, pick, peck, and put all the good grains into the dish. Before an hour was over all was done, and they flew away. Then the maiden brought the dish to her step-mother, feeling joyful, and thinking that now she should go to the feast; but the step-mother said, \\"No, Cinderella, you have no proper clothes, and you do not know how to dance, and you would be laughed at!\\" And when Cinderella cried for disappointment, she added, \\"If you can pick two dishes full of lentils out of the ashes, nice and clean, you shall go with us,\\" thinking to herself, \\"for that is not possible.\\" When she had strewed two dishes full of lentils among the ashes the maiden went through the backdoor into the garden, and cried, \\"O gentle doves, O turtle-doves, And all the birds that be, The lentils that in ashes lie Come and pick up for me! The good must be put in the dish, The bad you may eat if you wish.\\" So there came to the kitchen-window two white doves, and then some turtle-doves, and at last a crowd of all the other birds under heaven, chirping and fluttering, and they alighted among the ashes, and the doves nodded with their heads and began to pick, peck, pick, peck, and then all the others began to pick, peck, pick, peck, and put all the good grains into the dish. And before half-an-hour was over it was all done, and they flew away. Then the maiden took the dishes to the stepmother, feeling joyful, and thinking that now she should go with them to the feast; but she said \\"All this is of no good to you; you cannot come with us, for you have no proper clothes, and cannot dance; you would put us to shame.\\" Then she turned her back on poor Cinderella, and made haste to set out with her two proud daughters."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And as there was no one left in the house, Cinderella went to her mother's grave, under the hazel bush, and cried, \\"Little tree, little tree, shake over me, That silver and gold may come down and cover me.\\" Then the bird threw down a dress of gold and silver, and a pair of slippers embroidered with silk and silver. , And in all haste she put on the dress and went to the festival. But her step-mother and sisters did not know her, and thought she must be a foreign princess, she looked so beautiful in her golden dress. Of Cinderella they never thought at all, and supposed that she was sitting at home, arid picking the lentils out of the ashes. The King's son came to meet her, and took her by the hand and danced with her, and he refused to stand up with any one else, so that he might not be obliged to let go her hand; and when any one came to claim it he answered, \\"She is my partner.\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And when the evening came she wanted to go home, but the prince said he would go with her to take care of her, for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But she escaped him, and jumped up into the pigeon-house. Then the prince waited until the father came, and told him the strange maiden had jumped into the pigeon-house. The father thought to himself, \\"It cannot surely be Cinderella,\\" and called for axes and hatchets, and had the pigeon-house cut down, but there was no one in it. And when they entered the house there sat Cinderella in her dirty clothes among the cinders, and a little oil-lamp burnt dimly in the chimney; for Cinderella had been very quick, and had jumped out of the pigeon-house again, and had run to the hazel bush; and there she had taken off her beautiful dress and had laid it on the grave, and the bird had carried it away again, and then she had put on her little gray kirtle again, and had sat down in. the kitchen among the cinders."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The next day, when the festival began anew, and the parents and step-sisters had gone to it, Cinderella went to the hazel bush and cried, \\"Little tree, little tree, shake over me, That silver and gold may come down and cover me.\\" Then the bird cast down a still more splendid dress than on the day before. And when she appeared in it among the guests every one was astonished at her beauty. The prince had been waiting until she came, and he took her hand and danced with her alone. And when any one else came to invite her he said, \\"She is my partner.\\" And when the evening came she wanted to go home, and the prince followed her, for he wanted to see to what house she belonged; but she broke away from him, and ran into the garden at the back of the house. There stood a fine large tree, bearing splendid pears; she leapt as lightly as a squirrel among the branches, and the prince did not know what had become of her. So he waited until the father came, and then he told him that the strange maiden had rushed from him, and that he thought she had gone up into the pear-tree. The father thought to himself, \\"It cannot surely be Cinderella,\\" and called for an axe, and felled the tree, but there was no one in it. And when they went into the kitchen there sat Cinderella among the cinders, as usual, for she had got down the other side of the tree, and had taken back her beautiful clothes to the bird on the hazel bush, and had put on her old grey kirtle again."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"On the third day, when the parents and the step-children had set off, Cinderella went again to her mother's grave, and said to the tree, \\"Little tree, little tree, shake over me, That silver and gold may come down and cover me.\\" Then the bird cast down a dress, the like of which had never been seen for splendour and brilliancy, and slippers that were of gold. And when she appeared in this dress at the feast nobody knew what to say for wonderment. The prince danced with her alone, and if any one else asked her he answered, \\"She is my partner.\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And when it was evening Cinderella wanted to go home, and the prince was about to go with her, when she ran past him so quickly that he could not follow her. But he had laid a plan, and had caused all the steps to be spread with pitch, so that as she rushed down them the left shoe of the maiden remained sticking in it. The prince picked it up, and saw that it was of gold, and very small and slender. The next morning he went to the father and told him that none should be his bride save the one whose foot the golden shoe should fit. Then the two sisters were very glad, because they had pretty feet. The eldest went to her room to try on the shoe, and her mother stood by. But she could not get her great toe into it, for the shoe was too small; then her mother handed her a knife, and said, \\"Cut the toe off, for when you are queen you will never have to go on foot.\\" So the girl cut her toe off, squeezed her foot into the shoe, concealed the pain, and went down to the prince. Then he took her with him on his horse as his bride, and rode off. They had to pass by the grave, and there sat the two pigeons on the hazel bush, and cried, \\"There they go, there they go! There is blood on her shoe; The shoe is too small, Not the right bride at all!\\" Then the prince looked at her shoe, and saw the blood flowing. And he turned his horse round and took the false bride home again, saying she was not the right one, and that the other sister must try on the shoe. So she went into her room to do so, and got her toes comfortably in, but her heel was too large. Then her mother handed her the knife, saying, \\"Cut a piece off your heel; when you are queen you will never have to go on foot.\\" So the girl cut a piece off her heel, and thrust her foot into the shoe, concealed the pain, and went down to the prince, who took his bride before him on his horse and rode off. When they passed by the hazel bush the two pigeons sat there and cried, \\"There they go, there they go! There is blood on her shoe; The shoe is too small, Not the right bride at all!\\" Then the prince looked at her foot, and saw how the blood was flowing from the shoe, and staining the white stocking. And he turned his horse round and brought the false bride home again. \\"This is not the right one,\\" said he, \\"have you no other daughter?\\" - \\"No,\\" said the man, \\"only my dead wife left behind her a little stunted Cinderella; it is impossible that she can be the bride.\\" But the King's son ordered her to be sent for, but the mother said, \\"Oh no! she is much too dirty, I could not let her be seen.\\" But he would have her fetched, and so Cinderella had to appear. First she washed her face and hands quite clean, and went in and curtseyed to the prince, who held out to her the golden shoe. Then she sat down on a stool, drew her foot out of the heavy wooden shoe, and slipped it into the golden one, which fitted it perfectly. And when she stood up, and the prince looked in her face, he knew again the beautiful maiden that had danced with him, and he cried, \\"This is the right bride!\\" The step-mother and the two sisters were thunderstruck, and grew pale with anger; but he put Cinderella before him on his horse and rode off. And as they passed the hazel bush, the two white pigeons cried, \\"There they go, there they go! No blood on her shoe; The shoe's not too small, The right bride is she after all.\\" And when they had thus cried, they came flying after and perched on Cinderella's shoulders, one on the right, the other on the left, and so remained."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And when her wedding with the prince was appointed to be held the false sisters came, hoping to curry favour, and to take part in the festivities. So as the bridal procession went to the church, the eldest walked on the right side and the younger on the left, and the pigeons picked out an eye of each of them. And as they returned the elder was on the left side and the younger on the right, and the pigeons picked out the other eye of each of them. And so they were condemned to go blind for the rest of their days because of their wickedness and falsehood."}]
4	\N	Energy Petrochemical Industry	Julie Vormann	Newpaper article from April 8, 1987 in Houston	t	t	[{"type":"title","content":"Energy Petrochemical Industry"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc, the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. \\"I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,\\" said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co, adding, \\"There's no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones.\\" Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit argins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. \\"I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,\\" Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Pace's John Dosher. Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical  acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. \\"Companies like DuPont and Monsanto Co spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated,\\" Dosher said. \\"But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market.\\" Some top chemical executives share the concern. \\"The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes,\\" GAF's Heyman cautioned. \\"The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.\\" Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. \\"This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business,\\" Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth."}]
5	\N	Hansel and Gretel	Brothers Grimm	A famous fairy tale	t	f	[{"type":"title","content":"Hansel and Gretel"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Near a great forest there lived a poor woodcutter and his wife, and his two children; the boy's name was Hansel and the girl's Grethel. They had very little to bite or to sup, and once, when there was great dearth in the land, the man could not even gain the daily bread. As he lay in bed one night thinking of this, and turning and tossing, he sighed heavily, and said to his wife, \\"What will become of us? we cannot even feed our children; there is nothing left for ourselves.\\" \\"I will tell you what, husband,\\" answered the wife; \\"we will take the children early in the morning into the forest, where it is thickest; we will make them a fire, and we will give each of them a piece of bread, then we will go to our work and leave them alone; they will never find the way home again, and we shall be quit of them.\\" \\"No, wife,\\" said the man, \\"I cannot do that; I cannot find in my heart to take my children into the forest and to leave them there alone; the wild animals would soon come and devour them.\\" - \\"O you fool,\\" said she, \\"then we will all four starve; you had better get the coffins ready,\\" and she left him no peace until he consented. \\"But I really pity the poor children,\\" said the man. The two children had not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Grethel wept bitterly, and said to Hansel, \\"It is all over with us.\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\\"Do be quiet, Grethel,\\" said Hansel, \\"and do not fret; 1 will manage something.\\" And when the parents had gone to sleep he got up, put on his little coat, opened the back door, and slipped out. The moon was shining brightly, and the white flints that lay in front of the house glistened like pieces of silver. Hansel stooped and filled the little pocket of his coat as full as it would hold. Then he went back again, and said to Grethel, \\"Be easy, dear little sister, and go to sleep quietly; God will not forsake us,\\" and laid himself down again in his bed. When the day was breaking, and before the sun had risen, the wife came and awakened the two children, saying, \\"Get up, you lazy bones; we are going into the forest to cut wood.\\" Then she gave each of them a piece of bread, and said, \\"That is for dinner, and you must not eat it before then, for you will get no more.\\" Grethel carried the bread under her apron, for Hansel had his pockets full of the flints. Then they set off all together on their way to the forest. When they had gone a little way Hansel stood still and looked back towards the house, and this he did again and again, till his father said to him, \\"Hansel, what are you looking at? take care not to forget your legs.\\" \\"O father,\\" said Hansel, \\"lam looking at my little white kitten, who is sitting up on the roof to bid me good-bye.\\" - \\"You young fool,\\" said the woman, \\"that is not your kitten, but the sunshine on the chimney-pot.\\" Of course Hansel had not been looking at his kitten, but had been taking every now and then a flint from his pocket and dropping it on the road. When they reached the middle of the forest the father told the children to collect wood to make a fire to keep them, warm; and Hansel and Grethel gathered brushwood enough for a little mountain j and it was set on fire, and when the flame was burning quite high the wife said, \\"Now lie down by the fire and rest yourselves, you children, and we will go and cut wood; and when we are ready we will come and fetch you.\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"So Hansel and Grethel sat by the fire, and at noon they each ate their pieces of bread. They thought their father was in the wood all the time, as they seemed to hear the strokes of the axe: but really it was only a dry branch hanging to a withered tree that the wind moved to and fro. So when they had stayed there a long time their eyelids closed with weariness, and they fell fast asleep. When at last they woke it was night, and Grethel began to cry, and said, \\"How shall we ever get out of this wood? \\"But Hansel comforted her, saying, \\"Wait a little while longer, until the moon rises, and then we can easily find the way home.\\" And when the full moon got up Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the way where the flint stones shone like silver, and showed them the road. They walked on the whole night through, and at the break of day they came to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the wife opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Grethel she said, \\"You naughty children, why did you sleep so long in the wood? we thought you were never coming home again!\\" But the father was glad, for it had gone to his heart to leave them both in the woods alone."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Not very long after that there was again great scarcity in those parts, and the children heard their mother say at night in bed to their father, \\"Everything is finished up; we have only half a loaf, and after that the tale comes to an end. The children must be off; we will take them farther into the wood this time, so that they shall not be able to find the way back again; there is no other way to manage.\\" The man felt sad at heart, and he thought, \\"It would better to share one's last morsel with one's children.\\" But the wife would listen to nothing that he said, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B too, and when a man has given in once he has to do it a second time."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But the children were not asleep, and had heard all the talk. When the parents had gone to sleep Hansel got up to go out and get more flint stones, as he did before, but the wife had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out; but he comforted his little sister, and said, \\"Don't cry, Grethel, and go to sleep quietly, and God will help us.\\" Early the next morning the wife came and pulled the children out of bed. She gave them each a little piece of \\"bread -less than before; and on the way to the wood Hansel crumbled the bread in his pocket, and often stopped to throw a crumb on the ground. \\"Hansel, what are you stopping behind and staring for?\\" said the father."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\\"I am looking at my little pigeon sitting on the roof, to say good-bye to me,\\" answered Hansel. \\"You fool,\\" said the wife, \\"that is no pigeon, but the morning sun shining on the chimney pots.\\" Hansel went on as before, and strewed bread crumbs all along the road. The woman led the children far into the wood, where they had never been before in all their lives. And again there was a large fire made, and the mother said, \\"Sit still there, you children, and when you are tired you can go to sleep; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening, when we are ready to go home we will come and fetch you.\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"So when noon came Grethel shared her bread with Hansel, who had strewed his along the road. Then they went to sleep, and the evening passed, and no one came for the poor children. When they awoke it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister, and said, \\"Wait a little, Grethel, until the moon gets up, then we shall be able to see the way home by the crumbs of bread that I have scattered along it.\\" So when the moon rose they got up, but they could find no crumbs of bread, for the birds of the woods and of the fields had come and picked them up. Hansel thought they might find the way all the same, but they could not. They went on all that night, and the next day from the morning until the evening, but they could not find the way out of the wood, and they were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but the few berries they could pick up. And when they were so tired that they could no longer drag themselves along, they lay down under a tree and fell asleep."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It was now the third morning since they had left their father's house. They were always trying to get back to it, but instead of that they only found themselves farther in the wood, and if help had not soon come they would have been starved. About noon they saw a pretty snow-white bird sitting on a bough, and singing so sweetly that they stopped to listen. And when he had finished the bird spread his wings and flew before them, and they followed after him until they came to a little house, and the bird perched on the roof, and when they came nearer they saw that the house was built of bread, and roofed with cakes; and the window was of transparent sugar. \\"We will have some of this,\\" said Hansel, \\"and make a fine meal. I will eat a piece of the roof, Grethel, and you can have some of the window-that will taste sweet.\\" So Hansel reached up and broke off a bit of the roof, just to see how it tasted, and Grethel stood by the window and gnawed at it. Then they heard a thin voice call out from inside, \\"Nibble, nibble, like a mouse, Who is nibbling at my house?\\" And the children answered, \\"Never mind, It is the wind.\\" And they went on eating, never disturbing themselves. Hansel, who found that the roof tasted very nice, took down a great piece of it, and Grethel pulled out a large round window-pane, and sat her down and began upon it."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Then the door opened, and an aged woman came out, leaning upon a crutch. Hansel and Grethel felt very frightened, and let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said, \\"Ah, my dear children, how come you here? you must come indoors and stay with me, you will be no trouble.\\" So she took them each by the hand, and led them into her little house. And there they found a good meal laid out, of milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. After that she showed them two little white beds, and Hansel and Grethel laid themselves down on them, and thought they were in heaven."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The old woman, although her behaviour was so kind, was a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had built the little house on purpose to entice them. When they were once inside she used to kill them, cook them, and eat them, and then it was a feast day with her. The witch's eyes were red, and she could not see very far, but she had a keen scent, like the beasts, and knew very well when human creatures were near. When she knew that Hansel and Grethel were coming, she gave a spiteful laugh, and said triumphantly, \\"I have them, and they shall not escape me!\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Early in the morning, before the children were awake, she got up to look at them, and as they lay sleeping so peacefully with round rosy cheeks, she said to herself, \\"What a fine feast I shall have!\\" Then she grasped Hansel with her withered hand, and led him into a little stable, and shut him up behind a grating; and call and scream as he might, it was no good. Then she went back to Grethel and shook her, crying, \\"Get up, lazy bones; fetch water, and cook something nice for your brother; he is outside in the stable, and must be fattened up. And when he is fat enough I will eat him.\\" Grethel began to weep bitterly, but it was of no use, she had to do what the wicked witch bade her. And so the best kind of victuals was cooked for poor Hansel, while Grethel got nothing but crab-shells."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Each morning the old woman visited the little stable, and cried, \\"Hansel, stretch out your finger, that I may tell if you will soon be fat enough.\\" Hansel, however, used to hold out a little bone, and the old woman, who had weak eyes, could not see what it was, and supposing it to be Hansel's finger, wondered very much that it was not getting fatter."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When four weeks had passed and Hansel seemed to remain so thin, she lost patience and could wait no longer. \\"Now then, Grethel,\\" cried she to the little girl; \\"be quick and draw water; be Hansel fat or be he lean, tomorrow I must kill and cook him.\\" Oh what a grief for the poor little sister to have to fetch water, and how the tears flowed down over her cheeks! \\"Dear God, pray help us!\\" cried she; \\"if we had been devoured by wild beasts in the wood at least we should have died together.\\" \\"Spare me your lamentations,\\" said the old woman; \\"they are of no avail.\\" Early next morning Grethel had to get up, make the fire, and fill the kettle. \\"First we will do the baking,\\" said the old woman; \\"I nave heated the oven already, and kneaded the dough.\\" She pushed poor Grethel towards the oven, out of which the flames were already shining. \\"Creep in,\\" said the witch, \\"and see if it is properly hot, so that the bread may be baked.\\" And Grethel once in, she meant to shut the door upon her and let her be baked, and then she would have eaten her. But Grethel perceived her intention, and said, \\"I don't know how to do it: how shall I get in?\\" \\"Stupid goose,\\" said the old woman, \\"the opening is big enough, do you see? I could get in myself!\\" and she stooped down and put her head in the oven's mouth. Then Grethel gave her a push, so that she went in farther, and she shut the iron door upon her, and put up the bar. Oh how frightfully she howled! but Grethel ran away, and left the wicked witch to burn miserably."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Grethel went straight to Hansel, opened the stable-door, and cried, \\"Hansel, we are free! the old witch is dead!\\" Then out flew Hansel like a bird from its cage as soon as the door is opened. How rejoiced they both were! how they fell each on the other's neck! and danced about, and kissed each other! And as they had nothing more to fear they went over all the old witch's house, and in every corner there stood chests of pearls and precious stones. \\"This is something better than flint stones,\\" said Hansel, as he filled his pockets, and Grethel, thinking she also would like to carry something home with her, filled her apron full. i! Now, away we go,\\" said Hansel, \\"if we only can get out of the witch's wood.\\" When they had journeyed a few hours they came to a great piece of water. \\"We can never get across this,\\" said Hansel, \\"I see no stepping-stones and no bridge.\\" \\"And there is no boat either,\\" said Grethel; \\"but here comes a white duck; if I ask her she will help us over.\\" So she cried, \\"Duck, duck, here we stand, Hansel and Grethel, on the land, Stepping-stones and bridge we lack, Carry us over on your nice white back.\\" And the duck came accordingly, and Hansel got upon her and told his sister to come too. \\"No,\\" answered Grethel, \\"that would be too hard upon the duck; we can go separately, one after the other.\\" And that was how it was managed, and after that they went on happily, until they came to the wood, and the way grew more and more familiar, till at last they saw in the distance their father's house. Then they ran till they came up to it, rushed in at the door, and fell on their father's neck. The man had not had a quiet hour since he left his children in the wood; but the wife was dead. And when Grethel opened her apron the pearls and precious stones were scattered all over the room, and Hansel took one handful after another out of his pocket. Then was all care at an end, and they lived in great joy together. My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it."}]
6	\N	Jaguar sees strong growth in new model	Unknown Journalist	This is my description	t	t	[{"type":"title","content":"Jaguar sees strong growth in new model"},{"type":"subtitle","content":"Article from March 5, London"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Jaguar Plc is about to sell its new XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a strong reception based on its success in the U.K., Chairman Sir John Egan told a news conference. Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to 830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly below 1985's 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down. Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987. U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover, finance director John Edwards said. A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German competitors offered an \\"umbrella\\" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6 had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would restrict the car's price. Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a 12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of its receipts for longer periods, John Egan said. In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10 pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct of net sales and training two pct. Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the other half. The firm is in early stages of considering the building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg, but Egan said this would take at least another three years On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar's shares were last quoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday's close, after reporting 1986 results which were in line with market expectations, dealers said."}]

8	\N	Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like beacons	Ashraf Fouad	Article from Oct 19 1987, Bahrain	t	f	[{"type":"title","content":"Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like beacons"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"-- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night. One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield, was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday. The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60 metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S. Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it. The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section of the structure remained. U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S. forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had been caught laying mines. But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday and the Sea Isle City on Friday. Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran. Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping. But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result of U.S. intervention and Iran's response. The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a U.S. \\"tit-for-tat\\" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS. He said with this appraoch America would suffer \\"the death of one thousand cuts.\\" But for the United States to grab the initiative militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its shipping must pass, Schuler said. He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off, Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq. Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate. He said the United States should also threaten to mine and blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a settlement. Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by invading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties. Each side has attacked the others' shipping."}]

But it happened once that when the queen was bathing, there came a frog out of the water, and he squatted on the ground, and said to her: \\"Thy wish shall be fulfilled; before a year has gone by, thou shalt bring a daughter into the world.\\" And as the frog foretold, so it happened; and the queen bore a daughter so beautiful that the king could not contain himself for joy, and he ordained a great feast. Not only did he bid to it his relations, friends, and acquaintances, but also the wise women, that they might be kind and favourable to the child. There were thirteen of them in his kingdom, but as he had only provided twelve golden plates for them to eat from, one of them had to be left out."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"However, the feast was celebrated with all splendour; and as it drew to an end, the wise women stood forward to present to the child their wonderful gifts: one bestowed virtue, one beauty, a third riches, and so on, whatever there is in the world to wish for. And when eleven of them had said their say, in came the uninvited thirteenth, burning to revenge herself, and without greeting or respect, she cried with a loud voice: \\"In the fifteenth year of her age the princess shall prick herself with a spindle and shall fall down dead.\\" And without speaking one more word she turned away and left the hall. Every one was terrified at her saying, when the twelfth came forward, for she had not yet bestowed her gift, and though she could not do away with the evil prophecy, yet she could soften it, so she said: \\"The princess shall not die, but fall into a deep sleep for a hundred years.\\""},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now the king, being desirous of saving his child even from this misfortune, gave commandment that all the spindles in his kingdom should be burnt up. The maiden grew up, adorned with all the gifts of the wise women; and she was so lovely, modest, sweet, and kind and clever, that no one who saw her could help loving her. It happened one day, she being already fifteen years old, that the king and queen rode abroad, and the maiden was left behind alone in the castle. She wandered about into all the nooks and corners, and into all the chambers and parlours, as the fancy took her, till at last she came to an old tower. She climbed the narrow winding stair which led to a little door, with a rusty key sticking out of the lock; she turned the key, and the door opened, and there in the little room sat an old woman with a spindle, diligently spinning her flax. \\"Good day, mother,\\" said the princess, \\"what are you doing?\\" - \\"I am spinning,\\" answered the old woman, nodding her head. \\"What thing is that that twists round so briskly?\\" asked the maiden, and taking the spindle into her hand she began to spin; but no sooner had she touched it than the evil prophecy was fulfilled, and she pricked her finger with it. In that very moment she fell back upon the bed that stood there, and lay in a deep sleep."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And this sleep fell upon the whole castle; the king and queen, who had returned and were in the great hall, fell fast asleep, and with them the whole court. The horses in their stalls, the dogs in the yard, the pigeons on the roof, the flies on the wall, the very fire that flickered on the hearth, became still, and slept like the rest; and the meat on the spit ceased roasting, and the cook, who was going to pull the scullion's hair for some mistake he had made, let him go, and went to sleep. And the wind ceased, and not a leaf fell from the trees about the castle. Then round about that place there grew a hedge of thorns thicker every year, until at last the whole castle was hidden from view, and nothing of it could be seen but the vane on the roof. And a rumour went abroad in all that country of the beautiful sleeping Rosamond, for so was the princess called; and from time to time many kings' sons came and tried to force their way through the hedge; but it was impossible for them to do so, for the thorns held fast together like strong hands, and the young men were caught by them, and not being able to get free, there died a lamentable death."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Many a long year afterwards there came a king's son into that country, and heard an old man tell how there should be a castle standing behind the hedge of thorns, and that there a beautiful enchanted princess named Rosamond had slept for a hundred years, and with her the king and queen, and the whole court. The old man had been told by his grandfather that many king's sons had sought to pass the thorn-hedge, but had been caught and pierced by the thorns, and had died a miserable death. Then said the young man: \\"Nevertheless, I do not fear to try; I shall win through and see the lovely Rosamond.\\" The good old man tried to dissuade him, but he would not listen to his words. For now the hundred years were at an end, and the day had come when Rosamond should be awakened. When the prince drew near the hedge of thorns, it was changed into a hedge of beautiful large flowers, which parted and bent aside to let him pass, and then closed behind him in a thick hedge. When he reached the castle-yard, he saw the horses and brindled hunting-dogs lying asleep, and on the roof the pigeons were sitting with their heads under their wings. And when he came indoors, the flies on the wall were asleep, the cook in the kitchen had his hand uplifted to strike the scullion, and the kitchen-maid had the black fowl on her lap ready to pluck."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Then he mounted higher, and saw in the hall the whole court lying asleep, and above them, on their thrones, slept the king and the queen. And still he went farther, and all was so quiet that he could hear his own breathing; and at last he came to the tower, and went up the winding stair, and opened the door of the little room where Rosamond lay. And when he saw her looking so lovely in her sleep, he could not turn away his eyes; and presently he stooped and kissed her. And she awaked, and opened her eyes, and looked very kindly on him. And she rose, and they went forth together, and the king and the queen and whole court waked up, and gazed on each other with great eyes of wonderment. And the horses in the yard got up and shook themselves, the hounds sprang up and wagged their tails, the pigeons on the roof drew their heads from under their wings, looked round, and flew into the field, the flies on the wall crept on a little farther, the kitchen fire leapt up and blazed, and cooked the meat, the joint on the spit began to roast, the cook gave the scullion such a box on the ear that he roared out, and the maid went on plucking the fowl. Then the wedding of the Prince and Rosamond was held with all splendour, and they lived very happily together until their lives' end."}]

One day she had to go into the wood to fetch food for them, so she called them all round her. \\"Dear children,\\" said she, \\"I am going out into the wood; and while I am gone, be on your guard against the wolf, for if he were once to get inside he would eat you up, skin, bones, and all. The wretch often disguises himself, but he may always be known by his hoarse voice and black paws.\\" - \\"Dear mother,\\" answered the kids, \\"you need not be afraid, we will take good care of ourselves.\\" And the mother bleated good-bye, and went on her way with an easy mind."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It was not long before some one came knocking at the house-door, and crying out: \\"Open the door, my dear children, your mother is come back, and has brought each of you something.\\" But the little kids knew it was the wolf by the hoarse voice. \\"We will not open the door,\\" cried they; \\"you are not our mother, she has a delicate and sweet voice, and your voice is hoarse; you must be the wolf.\\" Then off went the wolf to a shop and bought a big lump of chalk, and ate it up to make his voice soft. And then he came back, knocked at the house-door, and cried: \\"Open the door, my dear children, your mother is here, and has brought each of you something.\\" But the wolf had put up his black paws against the window, and the kids seeing this, cried out, \\"We will not open the door; our mother has no black paws like you; you must be the wolf.\\" The wolf then ran to a baker. \\"Baker,\\" said he, \\"I am hurt in the foot; pray spread some dough over the place.\\" And when the baker had plastered his feet, he ran to the miller. \\"Miller,\\" said he, \\"strew me some white meal over my paws.\\" But the miller refused, thinking the wolf must be meaning harm to some one. \\"If you don't do it,\\" cried the wolf, \\"I'll eat you up!\\" And the miller was afraid and did as he was told. And that just shows what men are."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And now came the rogue the third time to the door and knocked. \\"Open, children!\\" cried he. \\"Your dear mother has come home, and brought you each something from the wood.\\" - \\"First show us your paws,\\" said the kids, \\"so that we may know if you are really our mother or not.\\" And he put up his paws against the window, and when they saw that they were white, all seemed right, and they opened the door. And when he was inside they saw it was the wolf, and they were terrified and tried to hide themselves. One ran under the table, the second got into the bed, the third into the oven, the fourth in the kitchen, the fifth in the cupboard, the sixth under the sink, the seventh in the clock-case. But the wolf found them all, and gave them short shrift; one after the other he swallowed down, all but the youngest, who was hid in the clock-case. And so the wolf, having got what he wanted, strolled forth into the green meadows, and laying himself down under a tree, he fell asleep."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Not long after, the mother goat came back from the wood; and, oh! what a sight met her eyes! the door was standing wide open, table, chairs, and stools, all thrown about, dishes broken, quilt and pillows torn off the bed. She sought her children, they were nowhere to be found. She called to each of them by name, but nobody answered, until she came to the name of the youngest. \\"Here I am, mother,\\" a little voice cried, \\"here, in the clock case.\\" And so she helped him out, and heard how the wolf had come, and eaten all the rest. And you may think how she cried for the loss of her dear children."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"At last in her grief she wandered out of doors, and the youngest kid with her; and when they came into the meadow, there they saw the wolf lying under a tree, and snoring so that the branches shook. The mother goat looked at him carefully on all sides and she noticed how something inside his body was moving and struggling. Dear me! thought she, can it be that my poor children that he devoured for his evening meal are still alive? And she sent the little kid back to the house for a pair of shears, and needle, and thread. Then she cut the wolf's body open, and no sooner had she made one snip than out came the head of one of the kids, and then another snip, and then one after the other the six little kids all jumped out alive and well, for in his greediness the rogue had swallowed them down whole. How delightful this was! so they comforted their dear mother and hopped about like tailors at a wedding. \\"Now fetch some good hard stones,\\" said the mother, \\"and we will fill his body with them, as he lies asleep.\\" And so they fetched some in all haste, and put them inside him, and the mother sewed him up so quickly again that he was none the wiser."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When the wolf at last awoke, and got up, the stones inside him made him feel very thirsty, and as he was going to the brook to drink, they struck and rattled one against another. And so he cried out: \\"What is this I feel inside me Knocking hard against my bones? How should such a thing betide me! They were kids, and now they're stones.\\" So he came to the brook, and stooped to drink, but the heavy stones weighed him down, so he fell over into the water and was drowned. And when the seven little kids saw it they came up running. \\"The wolf is dead, the wolf is dead!\\" they cried, and taking hands, they danced with their mother all about the place."}]

To those of you who have enriched student life through various clubs and societies, enhanced our sporting reputation or assisted the people of the city through Community Action I offer my admiration and thanks. Every one of you has made a contribution to the character of this institution and I take pleasure in acknowledging what each of you has done to make this such a satisfying academic and social environment.

May I wish you good health and good fortune in the future. I hope that graduation day will always bring back happy memories."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Honorary Graduates - The University of Nottingham, in common with other universities in Britain, is empowered by its Charter to confer honorary degrees on persons of distinction and those who have rendered great service to the University. Over the years since the granting of the Royal Charter in 1948, honorary graduates, starting with the first Chancellor, Lord Trent, have included politicians, musicians, men and women of letters, scientists, industrialists, lawyers, sporting personalities, all subsequent Chancellors and Vice-Chancellors and several long-serving senior employees of the University. The award of an honorary degree is the highest honour a University can bestow and may, in the case of Nottingham, be either a Master's Degree (Master of Arts, Master of Laws), or a Doctorate (of Divinity, Laws, Letters, Music, Science or Medicine). The actual degree awarded to an individual will be that which is most appropriate to his or her background and experience and carries with it all the rights and privileges of membership of the University. Before each honorary degree is awarded by the Chancellor, the candidate is presented by a senior member of the academic staff known as the Public Orator. In the speech, the public orator will highlight the major features of the honorary graduand's career, particularly those which have led to eminence and the reasons why the University is bestowing the honour. Anthony CLEAVER , Chairman and Chief Executive of IBM United Kingdom Holdings Limited, will receive the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LLD). Mr Cleaver joined IBM in 1962. In 1988 he became a member of the Board of Business in the Community. Roger GODFREY , President of the Council of the University of Nottingham, will receive the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LLD). He graduated from the University with an LLB in 1950 and is a partner in a solicitors' practice in Nottingham. Sir Charles MACKERRAS , Musical Director of Welsh National Opera, will receive the honorary degree of Doctor of Music (DMus). Sir Charles' career has included many periods conducting many of the world's major orchestras. Iona OPIE , the oral historian of childhood and, with her husband, of many books including Lore and Language of Schoolchildren (1959),The Oxford Book of Children's Verse (1973), and A Nursery Companion (1980), will receive the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters (DLitt). Jonathon PORRITT , campaigner on green issues, will receive the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LLD). He began his career as a teacher and is former Director of Friends of the Earth. Professor William STEWART , Chief Scientific Adviser to the Cabinet Office, will receive the honorary degree of Doctor of Science (DSc). Professor Stewart has been Secretary and Deputy Chairman of the Agricultural and Food Research Council since 1988. He was Head of the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Dundee between 1968 and 1983, and is internationally renowned for his work on nitrogen fixation in plants. Professor David WILLIAMS , Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, will receive the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LLD). Professor Williams has been Rouse Hall Professor of English Law at the University of Cambridge since 1983 and President of Wolfson College since 1980."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Ceremony - Today's Graduation Ceremony is a twentieth century version of a tradition which has its origins in medieval times. The modern ceremony contains only vestiges of the original Latin in such phrases as in absentia , for candidates graduating in their absence and honoris causa , applied to honorary degrees. Degrees are still however conferred by the Chancellor, whose title dates back to pre-Reformation days and whose authority is represented by the University Mace. A further modified survival from the medieval period is the academic dress of gown, hat and hood worn by graduates, University Officers and members of the academic procession. The varying colours of the gowns and hoods, and the more subtle variations in their style and cut, indicate the degree (Bachelor, Master or Doctor), the University which awarded the degree and even the faculty or subject. Further colour and splendour is brought to the occasion by the gold trimmed gowns and hats of the senior University officers: the Pro-Chancellors, the Vice-Chancellor and the Chancellor, whose gown has a long heavy train carried by his page. The procession which opens the ceremony includes academic staff of the University, Deans of Faculties, Pro-Vice-Chancellors, Honorary Graduands and Public Orators, the Senior Officers and finally the University Marshal, Esquire Bedell (the Mace-Bearer) and the Chancellor. Each ceremony usually starts with the presentation of one or more honorary graduands who are introduced by speeches from the public orators and then admitted to their degrees by the Chancellor. Thereafter each student passes before the Chancellor, who says ‘I admit you’ and at that moment the student changes from being a graduand (one who has satisfied all the requirements for a degree) to a graduate (one who has been admitted to the degree and is entitled to the privileges thereof including use of the designatory letters, e.g. BA, MSc or PhD). Students who are not able to be present are admitted to their degrees in absentia. At the end of the ceremony, the procession leaves the hall in reverse order, led by the Mace-Bearer and the Chancellor."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The University Past and Present - A rowing boat on the lake at Highfields Park is an excellent vantage point from which to view the building that most clearly evokes the University of Nottingham. The Trent Building, with its clock tower and sonorous chime, was, at its opening in 1928, a university in miniature. There were laboratories and lecture rooms, a library, a refectory, a ballroom and a theatre. This was an elegant and substantial location for higher education but it was to be only the beginning. Today the activities of 9,000 students and 1,000 staff are accommodated not only in the parkland campus of 330 acres surrounding the Trent Building but also within the adjacent Medical School and University Hospital and in the Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences some 10 miles to the south. It was over 60 years ago that Sir Jesse Boot (later Lord Trent), founder of the Boots Company, made a magnificent gift of land and money which enabled the University College to move from Nottingham town centre. Much later the Boots Pure Drug Co. endowed professorships in honour of Lord and Lady Trent which made a substantial contribution to the academic growth of the University. Other generous donations include those received form the Cripps family. They have endowed professorships and buildings, most notably Cripps Hall of Residence and Cripps Health Centre. Major expansion followed the granting of the Royal Charter in 1948. The monumental Portland Building rose in the early 1950s and teaching and residential accommodation space grew rapidly in the 1960s and 70s to keep pace with the growing demand for university places. A major new library opened in 1973 and soon afterwards Nottingham was proud to open the first Medical School to be established in Britain this century. In more recent years new buildings have included the Computing Centre, the Institute of German, Austrian and Swiss Affairs, research accommodation both at University Park and at the School of Agriculture, and further student residences. A new Arts Centre is nearing completion at the South Entrance. The growth of the University reflects the country's confidence in its contribution to education and research. Here at Nottingham it is recognized that the source of our special contribution to academic achievement is the quality of the people who work within it. The interaction of the enquiring and critical minds of students and staff, the pursuit of ideas and the desire to move forward the boundaries of knowledge are the hallmarks of higher education. The University has many staff whose work of outstanding international merit in many diverse fields has brought it great acclaim. Today pioneering work is being carried out in every faculty: engineers work on the motor car engine — botanists on plant breeding — physicists on the production of images of the soft tissue of the human body using revolutionary new techniques — social scientists on the political development of Eastern Europe and on computer systems which mimic human experts — literary scholars produce new insights into the works of major writers. The University is abounding with ideas which have been shared with those who have studied there. Growth is once again the watchword as the country looks for another period of expansion in higher education. Radical changes in the way education is delivered and increasing competition for scarce resources are some of the challenges universities will face in the years ahead. The University of Nottingham is meeting these challenges by maintaining its commitment to the highest quality teaching and research."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Student Life - Ask any university graduate a few years on what they best remember from their student days and the answer is unlikely to be anything to do with their course. Important as the academic qualifications are, university is as much about education in the wider sense of the term as it is about lectures, essays and exams. In this the University of Nottingham Union plays a central role, either running or being connected with almost all of students' extra curricular activities. On offer are over 150 clubs and societies ranging from Gliding to Gilbert and Sullivan and from Animal Welfare to Chess. For those with a competitive mind, all major sports are represented as are several up and coming ones, like Bat Polo and Korfball. Much students' time is also spent helping others. Through Community Action, over 1,000 students are involved in areas of work with the local community such as running a shelter for the homeless or teaching an adult to read. Karnival, another high profile area of the Students' Union, concentrates its work on fund raising and in the last year raised over £100,000 for various charities. If, as is so often said, one of the most important parts of life is getting on with people, our years at Nottingham University have certainly prepared us well!"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Beyond Graduation Day - Congratulations to all graduates and welcome to membership of a special group of people of a wide variety of ages and careers, in all parts of the world who share with you the experience of studying at this University. Nottingham Graduates have always been proud of their association with the University and you will find a special welcome form them wherever you go and whatever you do in the future. When you leave Nottingham you take with you enduring memories and friendships. We hope that you will build upon these so as to form a continuing association with your University. You can do this through the many Hall and Department associations, through clubs and groups at home and abroad.
